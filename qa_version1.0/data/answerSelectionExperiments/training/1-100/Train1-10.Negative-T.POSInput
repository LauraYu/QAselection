From her father , Young argues , she inherited a `` joyless earnestness '' that combined with her early interest in science to produce the roots of her public character .
And boys they were , teen-agers too young for the exercise of informed free will , yet sent on missions to Vietnam that many would later consider immoral .
This simple , powerful , engaging prose -LRB- translated from the Chinese -RRB- is the work of a young writer who at 16 was sent away from her family for eight years to a poverty-stricken northern province of China to fulfill the Cultural Revolutionary requirement of intellectuals .
To read Young is to discover that certain suspect analogies have informed the American perception of Thatcher as a conservative heroine .
Neither the assumption that Thatcher 's road to Damascus parallels Ronald Reagan 's own timely evolution from New Deal enthusiast to conservative idealogue , nor the thesis that the Iron Lady took the Tory party by storm in a political coup a la Barry Goldwater , survives Young 's analysis .
Young makes a persuasive case for the view that Thatcher 's less-than-true-blue ideology was mirrored in her policies .
The Tory campaign manifesto drawn up for the 1979 election that made Thatcher prime minister , in Young 's words , `` openly contemplated the perpetuation of the comfortable welfare state . ''
Young observes that `` There was a genuine clash of cultures , between an almost Cromwellian impatience with the status quo -LRB- on the part of the Thatcherites -RRB- and the mandarin world of Whitehall , in which skepticism and rumination were more highly rated habits of mind than zeal or blind conviction . ''
Despite Thatcher 's own ambition to go `` on and on , '' Young argues that in fact her era has come and gone .
`` Normally , I discourage people from entering politics if they have a young family and do n't have money , '' Barber said on Tuesday .
Major learned his politics as a Young Conservative on a soapbox in Brixton , a poor , racially mixed neighborhood in south London , where he took on the socialist Labor Party for its inept management of the area 's public housing projects .
BIOGRAPHY
This second volume of Ward 's lively and psychologically revealing biography begins with his honeymoon abroad in 1905 and concludes with his election as Governor of New York in 1928 .
The central riddle revealed here is why , as a woman in a man 's world , Margaret Thatcher evinces such an exclusionary attitude toward women .
The author , whose career as a political columnist has coincided with Thatcher 's as political leader , describes two qualities that are her greatest strengths : her `` sense of moral rectitude '' and her political intuition .
The Pulitizer Prize-winning author 's second book in a projected four -volume work on the life of one of our most complex presidents .
The author , a former investigative journalist , was able to elicit untapped recollections from Johnson 's old cronies .
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR ; A Biography by Deirdre Bair -LRB- Summit Books -RRB-
It took the author , recipient of the National Book Award for her biography of Samuel Beckett , seven years to answer these questions .
As a member of the white master tribe of South Africa , the author grew up thinking himself a `` Just White Man . ''
Boundary lines for the new Middle East were arbitrarily drawn on `` an empty map '' without any input from the leaders of those countries themselves , says the author of this carefully researched book based on recently opened archival material .
A passionately told epic of China by Yale professor and historian Spence , author of eight other acclaimed works on China .
The author 's dilemma was where to begin in a recorded history that spans 4,000 years .
There are two aspects of the Margaret Thatcher phenomenon -- neither of which is addressed in this splendid British biography -- that every thinking American needs to keep in mind when assessing the achievements of this remarkable woman .
In ideological terms , the author makes it clear that , her paternal education in conservative sentiment aside , not only did Thatcher come to the true faith much later than Reagan , but that between 1959 -LRB- when she first entered Parliament -RRB- and her crucial battle with Edward Heath for leadership of the Tory party in 1974 , Thatcher had barely two conservative ideas to rub together .
A high school dropout who drifted from job to job until he caught on as a bank trainee and rose to become chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher 's Cabinet , Major personifies the Conservative Party as rebuilt by Thatcher to recognize talent and reward merit .
Major , at 47 the youngest of Britain 's 18 prime ministers in this century , is himself a model of such a grit-and-guts rise out of poverty .
She has been active in local Huntingdon charities , and in 1987 she published a biography of opera singer Joan Sutherland .
He will succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister .
ON THE ECONOMY : In the mold of Margaret Thatcher , Major is a rigorous free-marketeer who will follow her policies of selling nationalized industries and holding down government spending .

Prize Worth $ 469,000
The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to two Americans and a West German whose work led to the atomic clock used as an international standard .
The chemistry prize went to two Americans for the discovery of surprising properties of the genetic material RNA .
The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech , 41 , of the University of Colorado , and Sidney Altman , 50 , of Yale University .
Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey , 74 .
Americans have shared or won the chemistry prize 36 times among the 112 times it has been awarded since 1901 .
Fifty-two of the 134 recipients of the physics prize have been Americans .
He went unrecognized by the dozens of reporters on hand for the Dalai Lama 's first Lhasang , or mountain blessing , since the Tibetan god/king won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago .
But he took full advantage of the hoards of minicams and shotgun microphones aimed at him Tuesday during the first U.S. stop in his `` Pilgrimage for Active Peace , '' organized by Buddhist leader Tai Situpa XII .
upon his arrival by helicopter for the Lhasang ceremony , the pacific grin never left the Nobel laureate 's face .
Since his elevation by the Nobel Committee and , subsequently , the media , to the instant international status of Peace Prize winner , he has become a very different kind of god/ king .
When he agreed to take a break from filming at Disney studios and accompany the new Nobel laureate on his pilgrimage , Gere had planned to use his celebrity to help the Dalai Lama past the worst of the predatory press .

Mr Geoffrey Whalen , managing director , warned that profits would be 'clearly worse ' this year in the face of the continuing steep recession in the UK new car market .
However , he reaffirmed his belief that the result would be favourable compared with those of other leading car makers .
Next month Fiat , the Italian car maker , will start selling an electrically-powered version of the Cinquecento , its new Polish -built mini car .
Even the most senior figures behind its introduction , Ettore Panizza , technical director of Fiat 's electrical and electronic systems division , and Fabio Massimello , production and marketing director of its electrical vehicles programme , acknowledge that its performance is 'miserable ' in comparison with the Cinquecento 's petrol-engined versions .
The Elettra , like an electric version of the more basic Panda which preceded the Polish -built car into production , exists because it is Fiat 's conviction that Italy 's cities will soon legislate and electric vehicle industry into being .
The legislation will not be identical to that of California , where any manufacturer wishing to sell more than 35,000 cars a year will have to make at least 2 per cent of them 'zero emissions ' -LRB- electric -RRB- starting in 1988 .
From 1994-95 , he says , cities across Italy will start closing their centres to all but electric cars .
As the trend spreads , so Fiat sees its electric car sales inexorably rising .
Perhaps the ultimate current demonstration of what purpose-building an electric car can achieve is provided by the General Motors Impact .
They see electric cars 'as little car for the city only ' , says Massimello .
'It is very important to try to get cost closer to that of an ordinary car , ' says Massimello .
Not least , he acknowledges , this is because there is little prospect of an EV ever being a direct substitute for an 'ordinary ' car , 'It will be only the second or third vehicle in a family , ' he believes .
The current price disadvantage of all electric cars requires a big effort to achieve economies of scale in component production , Panizza stresses .
But that means Europe 's car makers agreeing to share core componentry .
The sharing of specifications at an early stage may mean that the purpose-built electric cars of the late 1990s will share - under their differing skins and manufacturers ' labels - components that are mostly common and this relatively inexpensive .
LAST YEAR , the UK 's balance of trade deficit on motor vehicles shrank sharply from more than Pounds 6bn to about Pounds 1.5bn .
Much of the fall was due to a UK new car market collapse , preventing the usual high volume of imports from being sucked in .
Even so , Mr Geoffrey Whalen , UK motor industry veteran , past president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , and Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur , could derive much satisfaction from the export contribution made by Peugeot Talbot , the French vehicles group 's UK subsidiary , of which he has been chief executive for nearly a decade .
To put that in context , total output at Ryton was 87,000 cars , so the precise export content was just under 69 per cent .
The previous year , before the UK market began collapsing , Ryton built 116,000 cars , of which more than 81,000 went for export .
In addition , many of the parts used to produce the Ryton -built cars are imported from the Continent .
***** MIKE OTTY was taking something of a leap into the unknown when he decided to move from trying to set up an electronic rival to Glass 's Guide , the UK motor trade 's used car price 'Bible ' , to taking a job with Al Habtoor , a Dubai - headquartered conglomerate active throughout the Gulf .
From now on , vehicles will form only a part of his remit .
Inchcape is the world 's largest independent car distributor , although this will be the company 's first direct involvement in car importing and distribution in Japan .
The deal follows a plunge in sales of Peugeot cars in Japan .
Yanase Motors , Japan 's biggest dealer in imported cars , has decided to stop selling Volkswagen - Audi cars from next year .
For France 's bilateral import quota on Japanese cars , which has limited their penetration to around 3 per cent of the domestic market for years , is due to go by the end of this year .
Already , the Japanese share of the French car market has been allowed to creep up in anticipation , from 3.3 per cent of new registrations in 1990 to 4.1 per cent last year , according to the Comite des Constructeurs Francais d'Automobiles .
By 1998 , Japanese imports to France could rise from last year 's 82,440 vehicles to around 317,000 , or 11.1 per cent of the market , according to the European Commission .
The French government appears resigned to opening the floodgates , made inevitable by the 1990 EC - Japan car import agreement , under which the Community market is to be fully liberalised over a seven-year transition period to the end of 1999 .
Fuji Heavy Industries was planning to export Legacy saloons and estate cars to France at the end of September and expects authorisation soon to import Subaru cars .
Subaru France hopes to sell 1,000 Fuji cars in the year to March 1993 from 25 new outlets .
Yet the extent to which just in time stock control depends on Japanese style labour stability was sharply underlined by a strike at Renault 's main engine and gearbox plant last year , which took only 10 days to halt the group 's entire French and Belgian car production , starved of vital components .
Now the lines are divided into sections , each managed by an autonomous team , responsible for correcting its own faults as the vehicle moves through .
This is another way of cutting costs to the bone , but also reflects the fact that neither wants to get involved in the increasing electronic and specialised components found in modern cars .
Another part of the race to catch up with Japan is the time and investment needed to design and launch new cars .
The time taken to design and launch Renault 's latest small car , the Twingo , was in line with Japanese experience , says Mr Philippe Gras , deputy chief executive .
The result of all these efforts is to bring the French car industry 's productivity to just 10 per cent behind that of Japanese car producers in Britain , itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese in Japan , according to a study by consultants McKinsey for the European Commission .
It started manufacturing plastic components for cars in 1954 in Coventry .
which accounts for 75 per cent of its turnover , but other customers include Jaguar Cars , Rover , Honda and Massey Ferguson .
The news came as another of Europe 's big employers , Automobiles Peugeot , confirmed that it would be cutting its workforce by about 7 per cent by the end of next year .
In France , Automobiles Peugeot , part of the Peugeot - Citroen car group , said its cost-cutting plan would involve the loss of 4,023 jobs .
The decision , which was prompted by the depressed state of the European car market , is the latest in a series of job cuts by French industry .
Industry analysts said they expected further job cuts at French car and component manufacturers over the next few months .
CHAUSSON , the French automobile company which is jointly owned by Peugeot and Renault , said yesterday that it was suspending payments .
THE south-east Asian region , encompassing South Korea , Taiwan and the Asean block , has become an important force within the global automotive industry , and is providing the world 's vehicle and components manufacturers with some of the strongest growth rates and most substantial business opportunities to be found anywhere in the world .
During the 1990s the current boom in vehicle output is set to continue apace in the wake of rapidly-growing local demand and the development by a number of companies of important export markets .
From a total output across the region of 2.9m vehicles in 1992 -LRB- 1.9m
passenger cars and 1m commercial vehicles -RRB- production is expected to increase substantially into the early years of the next century and beyond .
The recently-published Financial Times Management Report , The Emerging Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry : Growth and Opportunities from South Korea to Turkey , which examines this sector in some depth is , for example , forecasting that by the year 2002 some 4.6m passenger cars and 2.8m commercial vehicles a year could be produced in South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines .
Growth in South Korean vehicle manufacturing is also likely to be substantial over the next decade - especially if plans by one or more participants in that industry for the establishment of overseas plants come to fruition .
So far , the motor vehicle industries of Taiwan and the Asean block have been largely dominated by Japanese multinationals , although opportunities have existed for American and European automakers , and will , indeed , continue to present themselves over the coming years .
Of Taiwan 's current tally of 10 vehicle manufacturers in early 1993 , eight assemble Japanese makes and three American or European models .
In 1992 , the Ford Lio Ho Motor Company , in which Ford Motor Company has a majority shareholding , accounted for more than a quarter of total vehicle output in Taiwan , and is planning an increase in production in the 1980s .
In Thailand , several makes of European vehicles are assembled in modest quantities by local companies , although General Motors is thought to be considering the re-commencement of assembly operations in conjunction with the Bangchan General Assembly Company .
The excellent potential of the Thai motor vehicle market could lead several other western carmakers to re-evaluate opportunities .
As in Thailand , the Malaysian motor vehicle assembly sector is almost totally dominated by Japanese models , although seven European makes of passenger car , and one American , were assembled in 1992 in very low quantities .
In addition , the official first and second national car projects involve respectively Mitsubishi and Daihatsu - although it is not inconceivable that an opportunity for a western luxury car manufacturer could present itself at some stage in the future , should a third national car project ever be formulated .
The position in Indonesia is little different from that in Thailand and Malaysia , although General Motors has been negotiating with two local companies for the establishment of further vehicle assembly agreements .
Within the small vehicle assembly industry of the Philippines , Mercedes-Benz in March 1993 received approval from the Board of Investments for the assembly of two models by the Commercial Motors Corporation under the newly-opened luxury car category of the car development programme .
FRENCH car manufacturers can not remember when times were so hard .
'There is n't any sign of an upturn for the rest of the year , ' says Mr Bob Barber at James Capel , who forecasts a full year decline in the French car market of about 15 per cent .
Registrations of Peugeot -Citroen cars in France fell by almost 19 per cent - to 300,500 vehicles - in the first seven months of 1993 .
Renault did better , but still suffered a fall of 12.7 per cent - to 314,000 vehicles , according to figures from the Committee of French Automobile Constructors .
Renault , the world 's most profitable car manufacturer in 1992 -LRB- in terms of the ratio of net profits to sales -RRB- , saw pre-tax profits plunge by by almost 90 per cent - from FFr5 .44 bn TO FFr730m in the first half of the year .
Peugeot-Citroen , which saw profits fall from FFr5 .53 bn to FFr3.37bn in 1992 , is expected by most car industry analysts to fall into loss this year .
'The results were better than expected , ' says one French car industry analyst , adding that the introduction of new models such as the Citroen Xantia and the Peugeot 306 would help sales , particularly with the introduction - in June - of diesel models .
'Renault has continued to strengthen its image at the expense of Peugeot , ' says one car industry executive in Paris , citing the Safrane , the high-end model which has enjoyed a successful introduction .
For both car manufacturers there is also the potential benefit of a weaker franc .
It has also announced that it is stopping production of its 405 model in its UK factory .
Car industry analysts in Paris say that , for Renault , the downturn in the market increases pressure to finalise its merger with Volvo , the Swedish car manufacturer , so as to achieve production economies .
A final deal , which is thought to be imminent , will give the merged company 12 per cent of the European car market and more than 20 per cent of the European truck market .
If the French government has sought to galvanise the two companies into a speedier marriage , it has also sought to protect the French car market from what it regards as unwelcome suitors .
Both Mr Longuet and Mr Alain Lamassoure , the minister for European affairs , have appealed to the European Commission to re-open negotiations with Japanese car manufacturers concerning the level of their exports to the European market .
The Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry had previously agreed to a reduction of about 9.4 per cent in exports to the EC , based on a fall in European car sales of 6.5 per cent .
But the mood of the French car makers is unlikely to have been improved by then .
PEUGEOT-Citroen , the French car manufacturer , announced a 11.4 per cent fall in sales in the first half of the year , reflecting the depressed state of the European car market .
Peugeot-Citroen said the results reflected a continued decline in the European car market , which saw sales of new vehicles fall by 17.4 per cent in the first half of the year .
Motor industry analysts said they saw little prospect of rapid recovery in the European car market , particularly in France and Germany , and forecast that French car sales would fall by about 15 per cent this year .
As a result , it maintained its share of the European car market at 11.9 per cent in the first half .
PART of British Coal 's defunct Coventry Colliery at Keresley , West Midlands , could become an import and export centre for Peugeot and Citroen cars .
The proposals include use of the colliery 's existing railhead as a transport and distribution centre for Peugeot , the French car group , which also includes Citroen .
Ashford Developments has prepared the proposals for the car distribution centre on behalf of Gesco , a wholly owned transport and distribution subsidiary of the Peugeot group .
The Keresley site is potentially attractive to Peugeot because it offers the opportunity to move cars directly by rail to the group 's distribution terminal at Calais after the Channel tunnel opens next year .
It would also facilitate distribution of Peugeot and Citroen cars in the Midlands .
Currently the cars are distributed through an import-export centre at Sheerness , Kent .
The French car manufacturer will announce results for 1993 on Thursday .
-LRB- Dollars 250m -RRB- for the group , reflecting the sharp contraction in the European automobile market last year .
By keeping the workforce intact , Ryton retains its capacity to make 120,000 cars a year .
Even with the saloon 306 , Ryton is unlikely to be utilising its full capacity unless export demand for both 306 models expands considerably .
Mr Whalen said there were no plans to reintroduce the larger 405 saloon - or its successor to be launched in France next year - to Ryton 's assembly lines alongside the 306 models .
The 405 , a big success in the UK fleet market , accounted for most of Ryton 's production until the Continental market slump led Peugeot to confine 405 output to France at the end of 1992 .

However , last year Peugeot Talbot still achieved its second best financial result since Peugeot took over the chronically loss-making UK operations of Chrysler -LRB- formerly the Rootes group -RRB- in 1978 .
Production has risen for five years in succession from only 19,977 in 1985 .
Net profits fell by 29 per cent from Pounds 104m to Pounds 74m , as the company became liable for a full tax charge after exhausting carry-forward losses in 1989 .
The Peugeot group had previously decided against substantial extra investment at Ryton , however , in favour of increasing capacity at its main French plants .
The company has already cut more than 700 jobs in the last six months reducing its workforce to just over 7,000 .
The plant has been working a four-day week for much of this year with 14 production days eliminated in order to reduce output .
The rate of production has been cut to 2,100 a week from a peak of 2,650 last year , but Mr Whalen said that five-day working would be resumed in May .
As a result the Peugeot marque increased its share of the market modestly to 6.2 per cent from 6 per cent a year earlier .
In the first quarter of this year Peugeot further increased its market share to 7 per cent .
Sales fell by 8.6 per cent to 31,857 compared with a plunge in the overall market of 21.6 per cent .
Mr Calvet , added that Peugeot 's consolidated revenue was fairly stable last year , against that of the previous year .
Peugeot posted net profit after payments to minority interests of FFr9.3 bn
At around L26m -LRB- Pounds 12,000 -RRB- in Italy , the Cinquecento Elttra will cost roughly 2.6 times as much as a well-equipped petrol version .
Where the rear seats of the conventional model will accommodate two adults in surprising near-comfort , the Elettra has only a raised platform behind the front seats , beneath which resides a lead acid battery pack weighing more than 700lbs .
The Elettra is thus strictly a two seater .
'At present , I think we will sell only 150 - 200 in 1992-93 , rising to 400-500 in 1994 and 1,000 - 1,500 in 1995 , ' says Massimello .
'But then we see a sharp rise - to 5,000 in 1996 , 10,000 in 1997 and 20,000 in 1998 . '
By 2000 , Fiat expects the Italian market alone to be absorbing 70,000 .
However , neither Fiat nor Peugeot is concerned about such high performance - at least for Euopean Markets .
'A customer might be expected to pay 10-15 per cent extra , not 2.6 times extra , ' he says .
For example , although Fiat has the capability to build an electric drivetrain in house , 'suitable electric motors need to be produced at a rate of at least 1,000 a day to get a financial return ' , says Massimello .
These UK -built 405s went to a total of 20 countries , although numerically by far the greatest proportion went to France and other EC states .
Despite the award , in financial terms Peugeot Talbot almost certainly remains a net importer .
Its rapidly rising market share in the UK - currently around 7 per cent - means that last year 's UK sales of around 112,000 units were met by 17,000 UK -built 405s and more than 90,000 Peugeot 205,309 and 605 models imported from Peugeot 's continental plants .
Given that in the early 1980s there were strong doubts as to whether Peugeot Talbot had any kind of manufacturing future in the UK , however , the company 's achievements are not to be underestimated .
Born out of the French parent 's takeover of Chrysler 's deeply-troubled European activities in the late 1970s , Peugeot Talbot inherited in the UK , for example , the ill-fated Linwood plant in Scotland and lacklustre models such as the Hillman Avenger , Sunbeam and Alpine - plus a valuable contract supplying Peykans -LRB- essentially rebadged Hillman Hunters -RRB- to Iran in quantities which at their peak hit 100,000 a year .
Bill Hooley , who , in January last year signed a three-year , Pounds 71,500 -a-year contract as managing director of Butte Mining , a London -listed company , has resigned .
Hooley will work for Butte four days a week as a consultant in Australia where he went after it took over two small companies there .
Dubai had seemed a sunnier prospect in more ways than one , as the UK motor trade and industry continued a long struggle to emerge from its early 1980s recession .
The two will hold equal shares in the company .
They are expected this year to be under 2,800 units , against a peak of 5,414 in 1990 .
Unless sales pick up sharply , Peugeot will have difficulty supporting the 180 Peugeot showrooms in the country .
The two companies will hold equal shares in Peugeot Japon , but it remained unclear whether stakes in the company would be retained by minority Japanese shareholders , including Suzuki , Seibu Motors and Nissho Iwai .
Mr Philip Mead , Peugeot Asia Pacific director , said : 'We are there to attack the market and take market share from German manufacturers ' .
Mr Jacques Calvet , the chairman of Peugeot , has condemned the deal as an example of how Europe has 'unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange ' .
One sign of this is its readiness to allow Nissan to buy out its French dealership earlier this year , ending 10 years of resistance to the deal .
Only 10 years ago it was unthinkable that Peugeot and Renault could face Japanese competition head-on .
Renault , reported well over doubled net profits last year , followed by a five -fold rise in earnings in the first half of 1992 and is proceeding so successfully with its alliance with Volvo that both partners talk of a possible merger .
Renault has cut its workforce by 25 per cent over the past five years , while Peugeot , less overmannned than its public sector rival , has managed a 5 per cent reduction over the same period .
The two groups have also successfully introduced just in time stock control , Japanese style production teams in place of the old line management system , reorganised their design departments , and modernised most of their product ranges .
As a result , Peugeot has over the past five years closed all its refinishing shops .
Renault and Peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming primarily designers and assemblers .
As a result , the proportion of bought-in components has risen steeply in recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at Renault .
Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been running joint audits on component suppliers ' quality , and are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers ' productivity and costs .
Here Peugeot estimates that the Japanese still have a substantial advantage , capable of launching a new model for around FFr3-4bn in three years , as against the French average of FFr6bn to FFr8bn in four to five years .
Peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results from 1994 .
Even so , Renault and Peugeot have some way to go before they can meet Japanese standards of productivity .
The decision opens the way for eight big foreign companies to enter newly liberalised Indian markets .
Peugeot will invest Rs1.20bn in the project , which has export obligations .
While the GE Capital proposal seeks to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in India , with an investment of Dollars 75m to Dollars 100m over the next three to four years , Morgan Stanley proposes an assets management company in the mutual funds and funds management industry , inviting direct foreign investment from foreign institutional investors .
Since 1992 , it is 25 per cent -owned by Peugeot Talbot UK and 75 per cent -owned by the French component manufacturer ECIA , itself majority-owned by Peugeot France .

GIB GROUP , the retailer which is Belgium 's biggest private-sector employer , is to cut 3,300 full-time jobs in its nationwide supermarket chain over the next three years .
GIB said 4,600 of the 17,000 full-time and part-time employees of the GIB supermarket chain would lose their jobs .
The company said the cuts in its supermarket activities would free BFr5bn -LRB- Dollars 144.5m -RRB- of new funds .
Overall , GIB employs just over 57,000 people directly , and 70,000 including franchises .
The past week has seen the announcement of more than 15,000 job losses , mainly by publicly-owned companies , prompting Mr Edouard Balladur , the prime minister , to urge restraint on the part of industry .
At Peugeot , the planned cuts included 2,547 jobs at the company 's Mulhouse , Sochaux , Lille , Sept Fons and St Etienne plants .
His appeal came the day after the announcement or confirmation of about 13,000 job cuts by French companies , described by the press as 'Black Wednesday ' .
The company said its difficult financial situation led to the decision to cut 4,000 jobs , almost 10 per cent of its workforce , by the end of next year .
Snecma , the state-owned maker of aircraft engines , announced it would cut the equivalent of 775 full time jobs in 1994 .
Bull , the computer group , confirmed an earlier decision to shed 6,000 jobs , including 2,850 in France , by the end of next year , while Thomson-CSF , the defence electronics group , confirmed plans for 1,700 job losses in the same period .
Company officials declined to comment yesterday .

According to this report , particularly strong growth is identified as likely in the automotive industries of Taiwan , Thailand and the Philippines -LRB- in the latter country from a very small base level of a few tens of thousands of units -RRB- for the 10-year period up to the year 2002 .
Another western opportunity in Taiwan is in the process of being realised : Volkswagen vans are to be produced by the Ching Chung Motor Company from late 1993 .
The downturn has taken its toll on the two principal carmakers , particularly in their home market .
For Renault , there is consolation in the fact that the company is winning market share from its domestic rival and from international manufacturers .
But the prospect of continued depressed demand raises a series of difficult decisions for the French carmakers .
Peugeot-Citroen has already announced reduced working days at its factories in Mulhouse and Sochaux in eastern France and is reducing its workforce by almost 3,000 this year .
Mr Gerard Longuet , the French industry minister , is pressing Renault to complete the alliance with Volvo to prepare the French carmaker for privatisation .
It will allow the merged company to achieve economies of scale and reduced production costs and enable joint marketing and research operations .
The two sides are expected to meet again in September to discuss the issue .
The company achieved sales of FFr73.05 bn
The company said that these effects accounted for about 4 per cent of the decline in sales during the first half .
The company said it enjoyed strong sales in the British market and consolidated its position in Germany .
The Wooton group , through its development manager Ashford Developments , wants to turn the surface site of the colliery into a multi-use industrial and commercial area , which could create up to 2,000 jobs .
Peugeot has a manufacturing plant at nearby Ryton .
The Coventry pit is also the subject of a bid from Coal Investments , the company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards , former commercial director of British Coal , who wants to re-open the mine .
The company has also bid to re-open the Trentham colliery in Staffordshire under licence .
Mr Gerard Longuet , industry minister , said the government was seeking to ensure the industrial future of Chausson , which is owned 50-50 by Renault , the state-owned automotive group , and Peugeot , its private-sector rival .
Chausson has two factories on the outskirts of Paris , at Creil and Gennevilliers .
Last year Peugeot Talbot made its first loss since the late 1980s - Pounds 8.7m before tax .
Mr Geoffrey Whalen , Peugeot Talbot deputy chairman , said there was little early prospect of more jobs at the Ryton plant itself , which employs 3,000 people .
This is because it has maintained double-shift working - with downtime and temporary lay- offs - in spite of the slump in UK and continental European markets which caused Ryton 's output to fall from a peak 116,000 units in 1990 .

Figures from Register-Meal , the media research company , show that the advertising of unit trusts -LRB- which does not necessarily include unit trust personal equity plans -RRB- , based on the rate card costs of advertisements in the media , increased substantially in 1993 .

Mercury Asset Management has turned to radio to increase brand awareness .
Richard Royds , managing director of Mercury fund managers , says the drawbacks of radio are offset by the advantages .

Koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the revelations of the Twelfth Seal .
The compound housing an estimated 95 followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh was destroyed after three fires were started by members of the cult , possibly with kerosene , according to the FBI .
The FBI said it believed Mr Koresh ordered a mass suicide and that there had been 'massive loss of life ' .
Mr Koresh and all but nine of his followers were presumed dead .
The FBI said that among the nine survivors were an Australian and two of the 26 Britons believed by the Foreign Office to have been in the compound .
One survivor was quoted as saying that , after the fires were lit , Mr Koresh advised his followers to 'relax ' because they would soon be seeing 'the face of God ' .
Attorney-general Janet Reno , who took responsibility for the FBI action , last night said the plan to move against the compound had appeared the best way to end the stand-off without bloodshed .
She absolved President Clinton of blame , saying he knew only generally of the plan , and added that the FBI had 'acted professionally and with remarkable restraint ' .
It started several hours after the FBI rammed the compound with tanks and fired tear- gas in an attempt to end the siege .
Only last week Mr Koresh warned FBI agents that they would be 'devoured ' by fire if they tried to harm him .
But the FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound .
A fire , which the White House said was deliberately started by followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh , destroyed the compound where the cult members had been holed up .
The White House said FBI agents were doing everything possible to rescue the 95 cult followers from the compound and that at least 20 people had left .
Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be inside the compound with Mr Koresh and his followers .
'They 're still pulling people out , ' a White House official said , adding that the FBI did not know how many would survive the fire .
FBI agents pulled out of the compound one reluctant woman who did not want to leave .
The blaze , which razed all the buildings in the compound , prompted fears that the cult may have embarked on either a mass escape through tunnels or mass suicide several hours after the FBI fired teargas at them in an attempt to end the siege .
talk to the attorney-general or the FBI .
There was no immediate indication of what happened to Mr Koresh , the religious leader who believes he is the incarnation of Jesus Christ .
Mr Koresh last week disappointed federal agents by failing to surrender on weapons and other charges resulting from the raid , which left four agents dead , that began the stand-off .
The FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
Mr Bob Ricks , the FBI agent in charge of the operation , said the teargas was fired to 'make them as uncomfortable as possible ' .
So why did Gran and Marks get it wrong ?
Anything but clear , as we were reminded by Panorama ; Sinful Messiah -LRB- BBC 1 , Monday -RRB- is whether the FBI were justified in mounting the assault on the Branch Davidian headquarters .
Fresh material given to Panorama , a taped conversation between cult-leader David Koresh and his lawyer late in the siege , suggests that Koresh did not want mass-suicide .
This the FBI dismissed as mere bluff , so Koresh 's deadline was literally that .

The drama mounted for the Australian Qintex group Monday with the announcement that the firm -- which failed two weeks ago to make good on its $ 1.5-billion bid for MGM/UA Communications -- now intends to sell off $ 600 million -LRB- Australian -RRB- in assets to reduce a crushing debt burden .
The financial restructuring was announced after trading was halted Monday on the Australian Stock Exchange while regulators awaited answers to their questions about the group 's obligations to Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43 % -owned affiliate that sought the protection of bankruptcy court in Los Angeles late last week .
Before trading halted , shares of Qintex Australia had plunged to 16 cents -LRB- Australian -RRB- from 33 cents on Friday .
The price of Qintex Ltd. , which owns 55 % of Qintex Australia , dropped to $ 1.50 -LRB- Australian -RRB- from $ 3.05 on Friday .
In another development , two outside Qintex directors resigned rather than approve payments to senior executives , Qintex Chairman Christopher C. Skase disclosed .
For the year ended July 31 , Qintex Australia paid the management company $ 32.6 million -LRB- Australian -RRB- .
The assets marked for sale include three Australian television stations and Qintex 's remaining 51 % stake in Mirage Resorts in Australia and Hawaii , but a company official said the firm will press ahead with its Dana Point resort project in Orange County .
With interest rates of 18 % to 20 % in Australia , the debt burden became intolerable to broadcasters such as Qintex , which acquired stations in a euphoric period two years ago only to be disappointed by slower-than-expected advertising growth and high programming costs .
Qintex 's resort business also has been hammered since Australian pilots began a strike in late August that reduced tourism revenue by as much as 32 % in September from a year earlier , one analyst said .
`` One of the good things about Qintex is it certainly has top-quality assets . ''
And -- until Skase bid for MGM/UA -- the Qintex chairman appeared to be a more frugal buyer of Australian assets , according to Shvets .
The letter was never delivered , however , and on Oct. 10 the deal collapsed amid rancorous accusations and a MGM/UA lawsuit accusing the Australian Qintex firm of fraud .
But analysts pointed out that Qintex had apparently counted on MGM/UA 's cash -- estimated at $ 145 million -- to help address Qintex 's short-term cash flow problems .
Some analysts were still reeling from the Qintex Entertainment bankruptcy filing last week , because they believed the U.S. company had the Australian 's group full backing .
When a $ 5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. came due , however , Qintex Entertainment sought the court 's protection because -- even with the help of Qintex Australia -- financing could not be arranged , the company said .
One of Qintex 's most visible assets remains the Dana Point resort project in Orange County , which an official described as a top priority now that the MGM/UA deal has collapsed .
`` This is very important to the company , '' said a Qintex official .
The company said it is still negotiating for financial backing in Dana Point with two Japanese companies , Mitsui & Co. and Nippon Shinpan Co. , which already own 49 % of the three resorts in Australia and Hawaii that Qintex says it 's selling .
Qintex bought two sites in the beach town for about $ 247 million this summer and plans to build a resort for affluent guests .
Qintex Australia Ltd. , the media and property empire built by entrepreneur Christopher Skase , went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off complete liquidation .
The cash-starved company , which has been in a downward spiral since its proposed buyout of the MGM/UA movie studio collapsed in October , asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group 's foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company .
The court appointed David Crawford and John Allpass , chartered accountants with KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords , as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
Peter Buchanan , a lawyer representing Qintex , told the Supreme Court in Victoria state that it is vital for Seven Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating so they do not lose their broadcasting licenses .
Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers , including the right to hire and fire , sell Qintex assets and borrow money .
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a Beverly Hills firm that is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia , said that firm now has `` little contact '' with Qintex Australia and still hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Qintex Entertainment has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to advance needed cash after the aborted MGM/UA deal .
The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation , he said , because the sale of all Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half the outstanding debts .
Qintex purchased the 232-acre parcel near Dana Point in southern Orange County last July and took an option on a 115-acre property nearby with the intention of building a luxury resort .
Local real estate experts said the price Qintex paid for the larger property -- $ 132 million -- was exorbitant .
Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in Hawaii .
The cash-starved company , which has been in a downward spiral since its proposed buyout of the MGM/United Artists movie studio collapsed in October , asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group 's foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company .
The court appointed chartered accountants David Crawford and John Allpass from KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
Qintex purchased the 232-acre Monarch Beach property from the Christopher B. Hemmetter and the Stein -Brief partnership last July for $ 132 million and at the same time took an option to buy the neighboring 115-acre Dana Headlands property for $ 115 million .
But Qintex earlier this month forfeited its right to the Headlands property when it missed an installment payment , and it now appears that the Monarch Beach property will be put on the block .
Peter Buchanan , a lawyer representing Qintex , told the Supreme Court in Victoria state that a receivership was necessary because it would enable Seven Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating and thus retain their broadcasting licenses .
The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation , he said , because a sale of all Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half of the outstanding debts .
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a Beverly Hills firm that is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to advance needed cash following the aborted MGM/UA deal , said the firm now had `` little contact '' with Qintex Australia and still hoped to emerge from Chapter 11 .

Jennifer Kirk of Thousand Oaks is studying acting at Moorpark College because she wants to be effective in her efforts to educate the public on Tourette 's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive behavior .
Perhaps the most unusual reason for taking an acting class is offered by Kirk , who said she has both Tourette 's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder .
This is a disease -LRB- not a form of retardation -RRB- that is controlled by medication .
The syndrome is a rare neurological disease with a variety of symptoms , including involuntary purposeless movements , swearing , tics and incoherent grunts and barks .

Right up there with them is Mary Trasko , -RRB- author of the coffee -table tome , `` Heavenly Soles , '' -LRB- published last fall by Abbeville Press -RRB- , who keeps an adored Roger Vivier pump , given to her by the designer , in the china cabinet of her New York apartment .
Trasko calls members of the haute shoe-buying clique `` shoe collectors or shoe enthusiasts .
Yet every enthusiast can name a designer who sends her into ecstasy .
So when her mother asked her which shoe she wanted , the lavender or the black , she picked up one of each , '' recalls Ragsdale .
If more is required , she takes them to a place where she has seen miracles worked : the Shoe Doctor on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles .
Tips from other footwear fanatics include : Stuff shoes with tissue or shoe trees .
After she began collecting Viviers several years ago , Trasko gradually threw out all her other footwear -LRB- except some plastic rain boots -RRB- and became a different person : `` I 'm happy to say , it has changed my life just to wake up in the morning and put on a perfectly designed pair of shoes . ''
But for shoe enthusiast Elizabeth Kellin that is n't good enough : `` I would have blown him up . ''
Cynthia Emmel , director of communications for the National Shoe Retailers Assn. , says the average woman in the United States owns 15 to 20 pairs of shoes and spends $ 50 for a pair of quality pumps .
