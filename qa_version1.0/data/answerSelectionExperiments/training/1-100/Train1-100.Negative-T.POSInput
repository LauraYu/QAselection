From her father , Young argues , she inherited a `` joyless earnestness '' that combined with her early interest in science to produce the roots of her public character .
And boys they were , teen-agers too young for the exercise of informed free will , yet sent on missions to Vietnam that many would later consider immoral .
This simple , powerful , engaging prose -LRB- translated from the Chinese -RRB- is the work of a young writer who at 16 was sent away from her family for eight years to a poverty-stricken northern province of China to fulfill the Cultural Revolutionary requirement of intellectuals .
To read Young is to discover that certain suspect analogies have informed the American perception of Thatcher as a conservative heroine .
Neither the assumption that Thatcher 's road to Damascus parallels Ronald Reagan 's own timely evolution from New Deal enthusiast to conservative idealogue , nor the thesis that the Iron Lady took the Tory party by storm in a political coup a la Barry Goldwater , survives Young 's analysis .
Young makes a persuasive case for the view that Thatcher 's less-than-true-blue ideology was mirrored in her policies .
The Tory campaign manifesto drawn up for the 1979 election that made Thatcher prime minister , in Young 's words , `` openly contemplated the perpetuation of the comfortable welfare state . ''
Young observes that `` There was a genuine clash of cultures , between an almost Cromwellian impatience with the status quo -LRB- on the part of the Thatcherites -RRB- and the mandarin world of Whitehall , in which skepticism and rumination were more highly rated habits of mind than zeal or blind conviction . ''
Despite Thatcher 's own ambition to go `` on and on , '' Young argues that in fact her era has come and gone .
`` Normally , I discourage people from entering politics if they have a young family and do n't have money , '' Barber said on Tuesday .
Major learned his politics as a Young Conservative on a soapbox in Brixton , a poor , racially mixed neighborhood in south London , where he took on the socialist Labor Party for its inept management of the area 's public housing projects .
BIOGRAPHY
This second volume of Ward 's lively and psychologically revealing biography begins with his honeymoon abroad in 1905 and concludes with his election as Governor of New York in 1928 .
The central riddle revealed here is why , as a woman in a man 's world , Margaret Thatcher evinces such an exclusionary attitude toward women .
The author , whose career as a political columnist has coincided with Thatcher 's as political leader , describes two qualities that are her greatest strengths : her `` sense of moral rectitude '' and her political intuition .
The Pulitizer Prize-winning author 's second book in a projected four -volume work on the life of one of our most complex presidents .
The author , a former investigative journalist , was able to elicit untapped recollections from Johnson 's old cronies .
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR ; A Biography by Deirdre Bair -LRB- Summit Books -RRB-
It took the author , recipient of the National Book Award for her biography of Samuel Beckett , seven years to answer these questions .
As a member of the white master tribe of South Africa , the author grew up thinking himself a `` Just White Man . ''
Boundary lines for the new Middle East were arbitrarily drawn on `` an empty map '' without any input from the leaders of those countries themselves , says the author of this carefully researched book based on recently opened archival material .
A passionately told epic of China by Yale professor and historian Spence , author of eight other acclaimed works on China .
The author 's dilemma was where to begin in a recorded history that spans 4,000 years .
There are two aspects of the Margaret Thatcher phenomenon -- neither of which is addressed in this splendid British biography -- that every thinking American needs to keep in mind when assessing the achievements of this remarkable woman .
In ideological terms , the author makes it clear that , her paternal education in conservative sentiment aside , not only did Thatcher come to the true faith much later than Reagan , but that between 1959 -LRB- when she first entered Parliament -RRB- and her crucial battle with Edward Heath for leadership of the Tory party in 1974 , Thatcher had barely two conservative ideas to rub together .
A high school dropout who drifted from job to job until he caught on as a bank trainee and rose to become chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher 's Cabinet , Major personifies the Conservative Party as rebuilt by Thatcher to recognize talent and reward merit .
Major , at 47 the youngest of Britain 's 18 prime ministers in this century , is himself a model of such a grit-and-guts rise out of poverty .
She has been active in local Huntingdon charities , and in 1987 she published a biography of opera singer Joan Sutherland .
He will succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister .
ON THE ECONOMY : In the mold of Margaret Thatcher , Major is a rigorous free-marketeer who will follow her policies of selling nationalized industries and holding down government spending .

Prize Worth $ 469,000
The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to two Americans and a West German whose work led to the atomic clock used as an international standard .
The chemistry prize went to two Americans for the discovery of surprising properties of the genetic material RNA .
The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech , 41 , of the University of Colorado , and Sidney Altman , 50 , of Yale University .
Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey , 74 .
Americans have shared or won the chemistry prize 36 times among the 112 times it has been awarded since 1901 .
Fifty-two of the 134 recipients of the physics prize have been Americans .
He went unrecognized by the dozens of reporters on hand for the Dalai Lama 's first Lhasang , or mountain blessing , since the Tibetan god/king won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago .
But he took full advantage of the hoards of minicams and shotgun microphones aimed at him Tuesday during the first U.S. stop in his `` Pilgrimage for Active Peace , '' organized by Buddhist leader Tai Situpa XII .
upon his arrival by helicopter for the Lhasang ceremony , the pacific grin never left the Nobel laureate 's face .
Since his elevation by the Nobel Committee and , subsequently , the media , to the instant international status of Peace Prize winner , he has become a very different kind of god/ king .
When he agreed to take a break from filming at Disney studios and accompany the new Nobel laureate on his pilgrimage , Gere had planned to use his celebrity to help the Dalai Lama past the worst of the predatory press .

Mr Geoffrey Whalen , managing director , warned that profits would be 'clearly worse ' this year in the face of the continuing steep recession in the UK new car market .
However , he reaffirmed his belief that the result would be favourable compared with those of other leading car makers .
Next month Fiat , the Italian car maker , will start selling an electrically-powered version of the Cinquecento , its new Polish -built mini car .
Even the most senior figures behind its introduction , Ettore Panizza , technical director of Fiat 's electrical and electronic systems division , and Fabio Massimello , production and marketing director of its electrical vehicles programme , acknowledge that its performance is 'miserable ' in comparison with the Cinquecento 's petrol-engined versions .
The Elettra , like an electric version of the more basic Panda which preceded the Polish -built car into production , exists because it is Fiat 's conviction that Italy 's cities will soon legislate and electric vehicle industry into being .
The legislation will not be identical to that of California , where any manufacturer wishing to sell more than 35,000 cars a year will have to make at least 2 per cent of them 'zero emissions ' -LRB- electric -RRB- starting in 1988 .
From 1994-95 , he says , cities across Italy will start closing their centres to all but electric cars .
As the trend spreads , so Fiat sees its electric car sales inexorably rising .
Perhaps the ultimate current demonstration of what purpose-building an electric car can achieve is provided by the General Motors Impact .
They see electric cars 'as little car for the city only ' , says Massimello .
'It is very important to try to get cost closer to that of an ordinary car , ' says Massimello .
Not least , he acknowledges , this is because there is little prospect of an EV ever being a direct substitute for an 'ordinary ' car , 'It will be only the second or third vehicle in a family , ' he believes .
The current price disadvantage of all electric cars requires a big effort to achieve economies of scale in component production , Panizza stresses .
But that means Europe 's car makers agreeing to share core componentry .
The sharing of specifications at an early stage may mean that the purpose-built electric cars of the late 1990s will share - under their differing skins and manufacturers ' labels - components that are mostly common and this relatively inexpensive .
LAST YEAR , the UK 's balance of trade deficit on motor vehicles shrank sharply from more than Pounds 6bn to about Pounds 1.5bn .
Much of the fall was due to a UK new car market collapse , preventing the usual high volume of imports from being sucked in .
Even so , Mr Geoffrey Whalen , UK motor industry veteran , past president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , and Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur , could derive much satisfaction from the export contribution made by Peugeot Talbot , the French vehicles group 's UK subsidiary , of which he has been chief executive for nearly a decade .
To put that in context , total output at Ryton was 87,000 cars , so the precise export content was just under 69 per cent .
The previous year , before the UK market began collapsing , Ryton built 116,000 cars , of which more than 81,000 went for export .
In addition , many of the parts used to produce the Ryton -built cars are imported from the Continent .
***** MIKE OTTY was taking something of a leap into the unknown when he decided to move from trying to set up an electronic rival to Glass 's Guide , the UK motor trade 's used car price 'Bible ' , to taking a job with Al Habtoor , a Dubai - headquartered conglomerate active throughout the Gulf .
From now on , vehicles will form only a part of his remit .
Inchcape is the world 's largest independent car distributor , although this will be the company 's first direct involvement in car importing and distribution in Japan .
The deal follows a plunge in sales of Peugeot cars in Japan .
Yanase Motors , Japan 's biggest dealer in imported cars , has decided to stop selling Volkswagen - Audi cars from next year .
For France 's bilateral import quota on Japanese cars , which has limited their penetration to around 3 per cent of the domestic market for years , is due to go by the end of this year .
Already , the Japanese share of the French car market has been allowed to creep up in anticipation , from 3.3 per cent of new registrations in 1990 to 4.1 per cent last year , according to the Comite des Constructeurs Francais d'Automobiles .
By 1998 , Japanese imports to France could rise from last year 's 82,440 vehicles to around 317,000 , or 11.1 per cent of the market , according to the European Commission .
The French government appears resigned to opening the floodgates , made inevitable by the 1990 EC - Japan car import agreement , under which the Community market is to be fully liberalised over a seven-year transition period to the end of 1999 .
Fuji Heavy Industries was planning to export Legacy saloons and estate cars to France at the end of September and expects authorisation soon to import Subaru cars .
Subaru France hopes to sell 1,000 Fuji cars in the year to March 1993 from 25 new outlets .
Yet the extent to which just in time stock control depends on Japanese style labour stability was sharply underlined by a strike at Renault 's main engine and gearbox plant last year , which took only 10 days to halt the group 's entire French and Belgian car production , starved of vital components .
Now the lines are divided into sections , each managed by an autonomous team , responsible for correcting its own faults as the vehicle moves through .
This is another way of cutting costs to the bone , but also reflects the fact that neither wants to get involved in the increasing electronic and specialised components found in modern cars .
Another part of the race to catch up with Japan is the time and investment needed to design and launch new cars .
The time taken to design and launch Renault 's latest small car , the Twingo , was in line with Japanese experience , says Mr Philippe Gras , deputy chief executive .
The result of all these efforts is to bring the French car industry 's productivity to just 10 per cent behind that of Japanese car producers in Britain , itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese in Japan , according to a study by consultants McKinsey for the European Commission .
It started manufacturing plastic components for cars in 1954 in Coventry .
which accounts for 75 per cent of its turnover , but other customers include Jaguar Cars , Rover , Honda and Massey Ferguson .
The news came as another of Europe 's big employers , Automobiles Peugeot , confirmed that it would be cutting its workforce by about 7 per cent by the end of next year .
In France , Automobiles Peugeot , part of the Peugeot - Citroen car group , said its cost-cutting plan would involve the loss of 4,023 jobs .
The decision , which was prompted by the depressed state of the European car market , is the latest in a series of job cuts by French industry .
Industry analysts said they expected further job cuts at French car and component manufacturers over the next few months .
CHAUSSON , the French automobile company which is jointly owned by Peugeot and Renault , said yesterday that it was suspending payments .
THE south-east Asian region , encompassing South Korea , Taiwan and the Asean block , has become an important force within the global automotive industry , and is providing the world 's vehicle and components manufacturers with some of the strongest growth rates and most substantial business opportunities to be found anywhere in the world .
During the 1990s the current boom in vehicle output is set to continue apace in the wake of rapidly-growing local demand and the development by a number of companies of important export markets .
From a total output across the region of 2.9m vehicles in 1992 -LRB- 1.9m
passenger cars and 1m commercial vehicles -RRB- production is expected to increase substantially into the early years of the next century and beyond .
The recently-published Financial Times Management Report , The Emerging Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry : Growth and Opportunities from South Korea to Turkey , which examines this sector in some depth is , for example , forecasting that by the year 2002 some 4.6m passenger cars and 2.8m commercial vehicles a year could be produced in South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines .
Growth in South Korean vehicle manufacturing is also likely to be substantial over the next decade - especially if plans by one or more participants in that industry for the establishment of overseas plants come to fruition .
So far , the motor vehicle industries of Taiwan and the Asean block have been largely dominated by Japanese multinationals , although opportunities have existed for American and European automakers , and will , indeed , continue to present themselves over the coming years .
Of Taiwan 's current tally of 10 vehicle manufacturers in early 1993 , eight assemble Japanese makes and three American or European models .
In 1992 , the Ford Lio Ho Motor Company , in which Ford Motor Company has a majority shareholding , accounted for more than a quarter of total vehicle output in Taiwan , and is planning an increase in production in the 1980s .
In Thailand , several makes of European vehicles are assembled in modest quantities by local companies , although General Motors is thought to be considering the re-commencement of assembly operations in conjunction with the Bangchan General Assembly Company .
The excellent potential of the Thai motor vehicle market could lead several other western carmakers to re-evaluate opportunities .
As in Thailand , the Malaysian motor vehicle assembly sector is almost totally dominated by Japanese models , although seven European makes of passenger car , and one American , were assembled in 1992 in very low quantities .
In addition , the official first and second national car projects involve respectively Mitsubishi and Daihatsu - although it is not inconceivable that an opportunity for a western luxury car manufacturer could present itself at some stage in the future , should a third national car project ever be formulated .
The position in Indonesia is little different from that in Thailand and Malaysia , although General Motors has been negotiating with two local companies for the establishment of further vehicle assembly agreements .
Within the small vehicle assembly industry of the Philippines , Mercedes-Benz in March 1993 received approval from the Board of Investments for the assembly of two models by the Commercial Motors Corporation under the newly-opened luxury car category of the car development programme .
FRENCH car manufacturers can not remember when times were so hard .
'There is n't any sign of an upturn for the rest of the year , ' says Mr Bob Barber at James Capel , who forecasts a full year decline in the French car market of about 15 per cent .
Registrations of Peugeot -Citroen cars in France fell by almost 19 per cent - to 300,500 vehicles - in the first seven months of 1993 .
Renault did better , but still suffered a fall of 12.7 per cent - to 314,000 vehicles , according to figures from the Committee of French Automobile Constructors .
Renault , the world 's most profitable car manufacturer in 1992 -LRB- in terms of the ratio of net profits to sales -RRB- , saw pre-tax profits plunge by by almost 90 per cent - from FFr5 .44 bn TO FFr730m in the first half of the year .
Peugeot-Citroen , which saw profits fall from FFr5 .53 bn to FFr3.37bn in 1992 , is expected by most car industry analysts to fall into loss this year .
'The results were better than expected , ' says one French car industry analyst , adding that the introduction of new models such as the Citroen Xantia and the Peugeot 306 would help sales , particularly with the introduction - in June - of diesel models .
'Renault has continued to strengthen its image at the expense of Peugeot , ' says one car industry executive in Paris , citing the Safrane , the high-end model which has enjoyed a successful introduction .
For both car manufacturers there is also the potential benefit of a weaker franc .
It has also announced that it is stopping production of its 405 model in its UK factory .
Car industry analysts in Paris say that , for Renault , the downturn in the market increases pressure to finalise its merger with Volvo , the Swedish car manufacturer , so as to achieve production economies .
A final deal , which is thought to be imminent , will give the merged company 12 per cent of the European car market and more than 20 per cent of the European truck market .
If the French government has sought to galvanise the two companies into a speedier marriage , it has also sought to protect the French car market from what it regards as unwelcome suitors .
Both Mr Longuet and Mr Alain Lamassoure , the minister for European affairs , have appealed to the European Commission to re-open negotiations with Japanese car manufacturers concerning the level of their exports to the European market .
The Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry had previously agreed to a reduction of about 9.4 per cent in exports to the EC , based on a fall in European car sales of 6.5 per cent .
But the mood of the French car makers is unlikely to have been improved by then .
PEUGEOT-Citroen , the French car manufacturer , announced a 11.4 per cent fall in sales in the first half of the year , reflecting the depressed state of the European car market .
Peugeot-Citroen said the results reflected a continued decline in the European car market , which saw sales of new vehicles fall by 17.4 per cent in the first half of the year .
Motor industry analysts said they saw little prospect of rapid recovery in the European car market , particularly in France and Germany , and forecast that French car sales would fall by about 15 per cent this year .
As a result , it maintained its share of the European car market at 11.9 per cent in the first half .
PART of British Coal 's defunct Coventry Colliery at Keresley , West Midlands , could become an import and export centre for Peugeot and Citroen cars .
The proposals include use of the colliery 's existing railhead as a transport and distribution centre for Peugeot , the French car group , which also includes Citroen .
Ashford Developments has prepared the proposals for the car distribution centre on behalf of Gesco , a wholly owned transport and distribution subsidiary of the Peugeot group .
The Keresley site is potentially attractive to Peugeot because it offers the opportunity to move cars directly by rail to the group 's distribution terminal at Calais after the Channel tunnel opens next year .
It would also facilitate distribution of Peugeot and Citroen cars in the Midlands .
Currently the cars are distributed through an import-export centre at Sheerness , Kent .
The French car manufacturer will announce results for 1993 on Thursday .
-LRB- Dollars 250m -RRB- for the group , reflecting the sharp contraction in the European automobile market last year .
By keeping the workforce intact , Ryton retains its capacity to make 120,000 cars a year .
Even with the saloon 306 , Ryton is unlikely to be utilising its full capacity unless export demand for both 306 models expands considerably .
Mr Whalen said there were no plans to reintroduce the larger 405 saloon - or its successor to be launched in France next year - to Ryton 's assembly lines alongside the 306 models .
The 405 , a big success in the UK fleet market , accounted for most of Ryton 's production until the Continental market slump led Peugeot to confine 405 output to France at the end of 1992 .

However , last year Peugeot Talbot still achieved its second best financial result since Peugeot took over the chronically loss-making UK operations of Chrysler -LRB- formerly the Rootes group -RRB- in 1978 .
Production has risen for five years in succession from only 19,977 in 1985 .
Net profits fell by 29 per cent from Pounds 104m to Pounds 74m , as the company became liable for a full tax charge after exhausting carry-forward losses in 1989 .
The Peugeot group had previously decided against substantial extra investment at Ryton , however , in favour of increasing capacity at its main French plants .
The company has already cut more than 700 jobs in the last six months reducing its workforce to just over 7,000 .
The plant has been working a four-day week for much of this year with 14 production days eliminated in order to reduce output .
The rate of production has been cut to 2,100 a week from a peak of 2,650 last year , but Mr Whalen said that five-day working would be resumed in May .
As a result the Peugeot marque increased its share of the market modestly to 6.2 per cent from 6 per cent a year earlier .
In the first quarter of this year Peugeot further increased its market share to 7 per cent .
Sales fell by 8.6 per cent to 31,857 compared with a plunge in the overall market of 21.6 per cent .
Mr Calvet , added that Peugeot 's consolidated revenue was fairly stable last year , against that of the previous year .
Peugeot posted net profit after payments to minority interests of FFr9.3 bn
At around L26m -LRB- Pounds 12,000 -RRB- in Italy , the Cinquecento Elttra will cost roughly 2.6 times as much as a well-equipped petrol version .
Where the rear seats of the conventional model will accommodate two adults in surprising near-comfort , the Elettra has only a raised platform behind the front seats , beneath which resides a lead acid battery pack weighing more than 700lbs .
The Elettra is thus strictly a two seater .
'At present , I think we will sell only 150 - 200 in 1992-93 , rising to 400-500 in 1994 and 1,000 - 1,500 in 1995 , ' says Massimello .
'But then we see a sharp rise - to 5,000 in 1996 , 10,000 in 1997 and 20,000 in 1998 . '
By 2000 , Fiat expects the Italian market alone to be absorbing 70,000 .
However , neither Fiat nor Peugeot is concerned about such high performance - at least for Euopean Markets .
'A customer might be expected to pay 10-15 per cent extra , not 2.6 times extra , ' he says .
For example , although Fiat has the capability to build an electric drivetrain in house , 'suitable electric motors need to be produced at a rate of at least 1,000 a day to get a financial return ' , says Massimello .
These UK -built 405s went to a total of 20 countries , although numerically by far the greatest proportion went to France and other EC states .
Despite the award , in financial terms Peugeot Talbot almost certainly remains a net importer .
Its rapidly rising market share in the UK - currently around 7 per cent - means that last year 's UK sales of around 112,000 units were met by 17,000 UK -built 405s and more than 90,000 Peugeot 205,309 and 605 models imported from Peugeot 's continental plants .
Given that in the early 1980s there were strong doubts as to whether Peugeot Talbot had any kind of manufacturing future in the UK , however , the company 's achievements are not to be underestimated .
Born out of the French parent 's takeover of Chrysler 's deeply-troubled European activities in the late 1970s , Peugeot Talbot inherited in the UK , for example , the ill-fated Linwood plant in Scotland and lacklustre models such as the Hillman Avenger , Sunbeam and Alpine - plus a valuable contract supplying Peykans -LRB- essentially rebadged Hillman Hunters -RRB- to Iran in quantities which at their peak hit 100,000 a year .
Bill Hooley , who , in January last year signed a three-year , Pounds 71,500 -a-year contract as managing director of Butte Mining , a London -listed company , has resigned .
Hooley will work for Butte four days a week as a consultant in Australia where he went after it took over two small companies there .
Dubai had seemed a sunnier prospect in more ways than one , as the UK motor trade and industry continued a long struggle to emerge from its early 1980s recession .
The two will hold equal shares in the company .
They are expected this year to be under 2,800 units , against a peak of 5,414 in 1990 .
Unless sales pick up sharply , Peugeot will have difficulty supporting the 180 Peugeot showrooms in the country .
The two companies will hold equal shares in Peugeot Japon , but it remained unclear whether stakes in the company would be retained by minority Japanese shareholders , including Suzuki , Seibu Motors and Nissho Iwai .
Mr Philip Mead , Peugeot Asia Pacific director , said : 'We are there to attack the market and take market share from German manufacturers ' .
Mr Jacques Calvet , the chairman of Peugeot , has condemned the deal as an example of how Europe has 'unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange ' .
One sign of this is its readiness to allow Nissan to buy out its French dealership earlier this year , ending 10 years of resistance to the deal .
Only 10 years ago it was unthinkable that Peugeot and Renault could face Japanese competition head-on .
Renault , reported well over doubled net profits last year , followed by a five -fold rise in earnings in the first half of 1992 and is proceeding so successfully with its alliance with Volvo that both partners talk of a possible merger .
Renault has cut its workforce by 25 per cent over the past five years , while Peugeot , less overmannned than its public sector rival , has managed a 5 per cent reduction over the same period .
The two groups have also successfully introduced just in time stock control , Japanese style production teams in place of the old line management system , reorganised their design departments , and modernised most of their product ranges .
As a result , Peugeot has over the past five years closed all its refinishing shops .
Renault and Peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming primarily designers and assemblers .
As a result , the proportion of bought-in components has risen steeply in recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at Renault .
Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been running joint audits on component suppliers ' quality , and are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers ' productivity and costs .
Here Peugeot estimates that the Japanese still have a substantial advantage , capable of launching a new model for around FFr3-4bn in three years , as against the French average of FFr6bn to FFr8bn in four to five years .
Peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results from 1994 .
Even so , Renault and Peugeot have some way to go before they can meet Japanese standards of productivity .
The decision opens the way for eight big foreign companies to enter newly liberalised Indian markets .
Peugeot will invest Rs1.20bn in the project , which has export obligations .
While the GE Capital proposal seeks to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in India , with an investment of Dollars 75m to Dollars 100m over the next three to four years , Morgan Stanley proposes an assets management company in the mutual funds and funds management industry , inviting direct foreign investment from foreign institutional investors .
Since 1992 , it is 25 per cent -owned by Peugeot Talbot UK and 75 per cent -owned by the French component manufacturer ECIA , itself majority-owned by Peugeot France .

GIB GROUP , the retailer which is Belgium 's biggest private-sector employer , is to cut 3,300 full-time jobs in its nationwide supermarket chain over the next three years .
GIB said 4,600 of the 17,000 full-time and part-time employees of the GIB supermarket chain would lose their jobs .
The company said the cuts in its supermarket activities would free BFr5bn -LRB- Dollars 144.5m -RRB- of new funds .
Overall , GIB employs just over 57,000 people directly , and 70,000 including franchises .
The past week has seen the announcement of more than 15,000 job losses , mainly by publicly-owned companies , prompting Mr Edouard Balladur , the prime minister , to urge restraint on the part of industry .
At Peugeot , the planned cuts included 2,547 jobs at the company 's Mulhouse , Sochaux , Lille , Sept Fons and St Etienne plants .
His appeal came the day after the announcement or confirmation of about 13,000 job cuts by French companies , described by the press as 'Black Wednesday ' .
The company said its difficult financial situation led to the decision to cut 4,000 jobs , almost 10 per cent of its workforce , by the end of next year .
Snecma , the state-owned maker of aircraft engines , announced it would cut the equivalent of 775 full time jobs in 1994 .
Bull , the computer group , confirmed an earlier decision to shed 6,000 jobs , including 2,850 in France , by the end of next year , while Thomson-CSF , the defence electronics group , confirmed plans for 1,700 job losses in the same period .
Company officials declined to comment yesterday .

According to this report , particularly strong growth is identified as likely in the automotive industries of Taiwan , Thailand and the Philippines -LRB- in the latter country from a very small base level of a few tens of thousands of units -RRB- for the 10-year period up to the year 2002 .
Another western opportunity in Taiwan is in the process of being realised : Volkswagen vans are to be produced by the Ching Chung Motor Company from late 1993 .
The downturn has taken its toll on the two principal carmakers , particularly in their home market .
For Renault , there is consolation in the fact that the company is winning market share from its domestic rival and from international manufacturers .
But the prospect of continued depressed demand raises a series of difficult decisions for the French carmakers .
Peugeot-Citroen has already announced reduced working days at its factories in Mulhouse and Sochaux in eastern France and is reducing its workforce by almost 3,000 this year .
Mr Gerard Longuet , the French industry minister , is pressing Renault to complete the alliance with Volvo to prepare the French carmaker for privatisation .
It will allow the merged company to achieve economies of scale and reduced production costs and enable joint marketing and research operations .
The two sides are expected to meet again in September to discuss the issue .
The company achieved sales of FFr73.05 bn
The company said that these effects accounted for about 4 per cent of the decline in sales during the first half .
The company said it enjoyed strong sales in the British market and consolidated its position in Germany .
The Wooton group , through its development manager Ashford Developments , wants to turn the surface site of the colliery into a multi-use industrial and commercial area , which could create up to 2,000 jobs .
Peugeot has a manufacturing plant at nearby Ryton .
The Coventry pit is also the subject of a bid from Coal Investments , the company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards , former commercial director of British Coal , who wants to re-open the mine .
The company has also bid to re-open the Trentham colliery in Staffordshire under licence .
Mr Gerard Longuet , industry minister , said the government was seeking to ensure the industrial future of Chausson , which is owned 50-50 by Renault , the state-owned automotive group , and Peugeot , its private-sector rival .
Chausson has two factories on the outskirts of Paris , at Creil and Gennevilliers .
Last year Peugeot Talbot made its first loss since the late 1980s - Pounds 8.7m before tax .
Mr Geoffrey Whalen , Peugeot Talbot deputy chairman , said there was little early prospect of more jobs at the Ryton plant itself , which employs 3,000 people .
This is because it has maintained double-shift working - with downtime and temporary lay- offs - in spite of the slump in UK and continental European markets which caused Ryton 's output to fall from a peak 116,000 units in 1990 .

Figures from Register-Meal , the media research company , show that the advertising of unit trusts -LRB- which does not necessarily include unit trust personal equity plans -RRB- , based on the rate card costs of advertisements in the media , increased substantially in 1993 .

Mercury Asset Management has turned to radio to increase brand awareness .
Richard Royds , managing director of Mercury fund managers , says the drawbacks of radio are offset by the advantages .

Koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the revelations of the Twelfth Seal .
The compound housing an estimated 95 followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh was destroyed after three fires were started by members of the cult , possibly with kerosene , according to the FBI .
The FBI said it believed Mr Koresh ordered a mass suicide and that there had been 'massive loss of life ' .
Mr Koresh and all but nine of his followers were presumed dead .
The FBI said that among the nine survivors were an Australian and two of the 26 Britons believed by the Foreign Office to have been in the compound .
One survivor was quoted as saying that , after the fires were lit , Mr Koresh advised his followers to 'relax ' because they would soon be seeing 'the face of God ' .
Attorney-general Janet Reno , who took responsibility for the FBI action , last night said the plan to move against the compound had appeared the best way to end the stand-off without bloodshed .
She absolved President Clinton of blame , saying he knew only generally of the plan , and added that the FBI had 'acted professionally and with remarkable restraint ' .
It started several hours after the FBI rammed the compound with tanks and fired tear- gas in an attempt to end the siege .
Only last week Mr Koresh warned FBI agents that they would be 'devoured ' by fire if they tried to harm him .
But the FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound .
A fire , which the White House said was deliberately started by followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh , destroyed the compound where the cult members had been holed up .
The White House said FBI agents were doing everything possible to rescue the 95 cult followers from the compound and that at least 20 people had left .
Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be inside the compound with Mr Koresh and his followers .
'They 're still pulling people out , ' a White House official said , adding that the FBI did not know how many would survive the fire .
FBI agents pulled out of the compound one reluctant woman who did not want to leave .
The blaze , which razed all the buildings in the compound , prompted fears that the cult may have embarked on either a mass escape through tunnels or mass suicide several hours after the FBI fired teargas at them in an attempt to end the siege .
talk to the attorney-general or the FBI .
There was no immediate indication of what happened to Mr Koresh , the religious leader who believes he is the incarnation of Jesus Christ .
Mr Koresh last week disappointed federal agents by failing to surrender on weapons and other charges resulting from the raid , which left four agents dead , that began the stand-off .
The FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
Mr Bob Ricks , the FBI agent in charge of the operation , said the teargas was fired to 'make them as uncomfortable as possible ' .
So why did Gran and Marks get it wrong ?
Anything but clear , as we were reminded by Panorama ; Sinful Messiah -LRB- BBC 1 , Monday -RRB- is whether the FBI were justified in mounting the assault on the Branch Davidian headquarters .
Fresh material given to Panorama , a taped conversation between cult-leader David Koresh and his lawyer late in the siege , suggests that Koresh did not want mass-suicide .
This the FBI dismissed as mere bluff , so Koresh 's deadline was literally that .

The drama mounted for the Australian Qintex group Monday with the announcement that the firm -- which failed two weeks ago to make good on its $ 1.5-billion bid for MGM/UA Communications -- now intends to sell off $ 600 million -LRB- Australian -RRB- in assets to reduce a crushing debt burden .
The financial restructuring was announced after trading was halted Monday on the Australian Stock Exchange while regulators awaited answers to their questions about the group 's obligations to Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43 % -owned affiliate that sought the protection of bankruptcy court in Los Angeles late last week .
Before trading halted , shares of Qintex Australia had plunged to 16 cents -LRB- Australian -RRB- from 33 cents on Friday .
The price of Qintex Ltd. , which owns 55 % of Qintex Australia , dropped to $ 1.50 -LRB- Australian -RRB- from $ 3.05 on Friday .
In another development , two outside Qintex directors resigned rather than approve payments to senior executives , Qintex Chairman Christopher C. Skase disclosed .
For the year ended July 31 , Qintex Australia paid the management company $ 32.6 million -LRB- Australian -RRB- .
The assets marked for sale include three Australian television stations and Qintex 's remaining 51 % stake in Mirage Resorts in Australia and Hawaii , but a company official said the firm will press ahead with its Dana Point resort project in Orange County .
With interest rates of 18 % to 20 % in Australia , the debt burden became intolerable to broadcasters such as Qintex , which acquired stations in a euphoric period two years ago only to be disappointed by slower-than-expected advertising growth and high programming costs .
Qintex 's resort business also has been hammered since Australian pilots began a strike in late August that reduced tourism revenue by as much as 32 % in September from a year earlier , one analyst said .
`` One of the good things about Qintex is it certainly has top-quality assets . ''
And -- until Skase bid for MGM/UA -- the Qintex chairman appeared to be a more frugal buyer of Australian assets , according to Shvets .
The letter was never delivered , however , and on Oct. 10 the deal collapsed amid rancorous accusations and a MGM/UA lawsuit accusing the Australian Qintex firm of fraud .
But analysts pointed out that Qintex had apparently counted on MGM/UA 's cash -- estimated at $ 145 million -- to help address Qintex 's short-term cash flow problems .
Some analysts were still reeling from the Qintex Entertainment bankruptcy filing last week , because they believed the U.S. company had the Australian 's group full backing .
When a $ 5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. came due , however , Qintex Entertainment sought the court 's protection because -- even with the help of Qintex Australia -- financing could not be arranged , the company said .
One of Qintex 's most visible assets remains the Dana Point resort project in Orange County , which an official described as a top priority now that the MGM/UA deal has collapsed .
`` This is very important to the company , '' said a Qintex official .
The company said it is still negotiating for financial backing in Dana Point with two Japanese companies , Mitsui & Co. and Nippon Shinpan Co. , which already own 49 % of the three resorts in Australia and Hawaii that Qintex says it 's selling .
Qintex bought two sites in the beach town for about $ 247 million this summer and plans to build a resort for affluent guests .
Qintex Australia Ltd. , the media and property empire built by entrepreneur Christopher Skase , went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off complete liquidation .
The cash-starved company , which has been in a downward spiral since its proposed buyout of the MGM/UA movie studio collapsed in October , asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group 's foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company .
The court appointed David Crawford and John Allpass , chartered accountants with KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords , as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
Peter Buchanan , a lawyer representing Qintex , told the Supreme Court in Victoria state that it is vital for Seven Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating so they do not lose their broadcasting licenses .
Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers , including the right to hire and fire , sell Qintex assets and borrow money .
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a Beverly Hills firm that is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia , said that firm now has `` little contact '' with Qintex Australia and still hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Qintex Entertainment has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to advance needed cash after the aborted MGM/UA deal .
The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation , he said , because the sale of all Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half the outstanding debts .
Qintex purchased the 232-acre parcel near Dana Point in southern Orange County last July and took an option on a 115-acre property nearby with the intention of building a luxury resort .
Local real estate experts said the price Qintex paid for the larger property -- $ 132 million -- was exorbitant .
Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in Hawaii .
The cash-starved company , which has been in a downward spiral since its proposed buyout of the MGM/United Artists movie studio collapsed in October , asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group 's foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company .
The court appointed chartered accountants David Crawford and John Allpass from KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
Qintex purchased the 232-acre Monarch Beach property from the Christopher B. Hemmetter and the Stein -Brief partnership last July for $ 132 million and at the same time took an option to buy the neighboring 115-acre Dana Headlands property for $ 115 million .
But Qintex earlier this month forfeited its right to the Headlands property when it missed an installment payment , and it now appears that the Monarch Beach property will be put on the block .
Peter Buchanan , a lawyer representing Qintex , told the Supreme Court in Victoria state that a receivership was necessary because it would enable Seven Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating and thus retain their broadcasting licenses .
The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation , he said , because a sale of all Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half of the outstanding debts .
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a Beverly Hills firm that is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to advance needed cash following the aborted MGM/UA deal , said the firm now had `` little contact '' with Qintex Australia and still hoped to emerge from Chapter 11 .

Jennifer Kirk of Thousand Oaks is studying acting at Moorpark College because she wants to be effective in her efforts to educate the public on Tourette 's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive behavior .
Perhaps the most unusual reason for taking an acting class is offered by Kirk , who said she has both Tourette 's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder .
This is a disease -LRB- not a form of retardation -RRB- that is controlled by medication .
The syndrome is a rare neurological disease with a variety of symptoms , including involuntary purposeless movements , swearing , tics and incoherent grunts and barks .

Trasko calls members of the haute shoe-buying clique `` shoe collectors or shoe enthusiasts .
Yet every enthusiast can name a designer who sends her into ecstasy .
So when her mother asked her which shoe she wanted , the lavender or the black , she picked up one of each , '' recalls Ragsdale .
If more is required , she takes them to a place where she has seen miracles worked : the Shoe Doctor on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles .
Tips from other footwear fanatics include : Stuff shoes with tissue or shoe trees .
After she began collecting Viviers several years ago , Trasko gradually threw out all her other footwear -LRB- except some plastic rain boots -RRB- and became a different person : `` I 'm happy to say , it has changed my life just to wake up in the morning and put on a perfectly designed pair of shoes . ''
But for shoe enthusiast Elizabeth Kellin that is n't good enough : `` I would have blown him up . ''
Cynthia Emmel , director of communications for the National Shoe Retailers Assn. , says the average woman in the United States owns 15 to 20 pairs of shoes and spends $ 50 for a pair of quality pumps .

The balance sheet , meanwhile , was strengthened by a Pounds 2.75m increase in the transfer fee reserve to Pounds 4m , the facility which allows the club to set aside a proportion of profits to cover future player acquisitions and a possible fall in gate receipts should the team falter in league and cup competitions .
Manchester United yesterday announced a sharp increase in full year profits as the Premiership champions benefited from increasingly lucrative non-footballing activities .
Although the figures were flattered by relatively low spending on new players and capacity constraints last year , Mr Martin Edwards , chief executive , said the improvement had persuaded the club to draw up plans to expand Old Trafford by more than 22 per cent .
To ensure success in Europe , the club will have to spend more on English players - denting future profits .
Payments to such players last year pushed staff costs up to Pounds 11.1m -LRB- Pounds 7.59m -RRB- , a figure likely to increase .

-LRB- Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN 8 Mar 94 p 11 -RRB- Financial Issues - Chinese Provinces Urge Japanese Banks To Set Up Branches -- Provincial and municipal governments in China 's interior areas have requested that Japan 's major commercial banks , such as Sanwa and Sumitomo , establish branches and representative offices in their jurisdictions , according to the 10 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN .
In the past , Japanese banks have focused on China 's coastal areas , where Japanese companies have made conspicuous inroads , but now they are responding to requests made by city and provincial governments in inland areas and are seriously looking into setting up offices there .
Despite the fact that investment by Japanese companies in these regions is still rather limited , the banks are now seriously considering where to set up offices in China 's interior areas .
Sumitomo Bank is Offering seminars to financial institutions in Beijing to enhance its presence there , while the presidents of the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank recently visited China and appealed to the mayor of Beijing for authorization to establish branches .
China To Authorize Japanese Banks To Use Yuan - Japanese banks will be authorized to use the Chinese yuan , but initially only for deposit-taking functions , according to the 8 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN .
The People 's Bank of China has not specified how deposits will be obtained or precisely when the deposit-taking functions will begin , but major Japanese commercial banks understand from discussions with the People 's Bank that they will be able to start taking yuan -based deposits sometime in the spring or summer of 1994 .
The Ministry of Finance has continued to press the Chinese Government to authorize Japanese banks to use the Chinese currency because the recent change in China 's foreign exchange system is having an adverse effect on Japanese banks doing business there , according the 4 February NIKKEI KINYU .
When a Japanese company operating in China sells yuan and buys a foreign currency , it must first transfer the money to the People 's Bank of China , where the Japanese bank has an account , thereby making it more troublesome for the company to use a Japanese rather than a Chinese bank .
According to the 8 March NIKKEI KINYU , some people assert that authorization to use the yuan is a `` matter of life or death '' for Japanese banks in China , and the recent indication that the yuan can be used for deposit-taking functions is being interpreted by Japanese banks as the `` first step '' toward full banking operations .

The role of PRC -funded firms in stoking the Hong Kong real estate market has attracted the scrutiny of Chen Yuan , vice president of the People 's Bank of China and son of elder leader Chen Yun .

However , Chen Yuan said that it was normal for PRC -funded enterprises in Hong Kong to buy office buildings and residences for their staff , adding that the Bank of China ran its banking business in Hong Kong independently , determining its scale of mortgage lending according to the market situation .

A recent article in a Seoul journal features the views of two experts on North Korea on the DPRK 's interest in China 's reforms and the prospect for change in North Korea .
In the 3 February SISA JOURNAL , Kim Pong-tok , a professor at Northeast Finance University in China , gave the following reasons as to why North Korea would be interested in China 's approach to reform : a -RRB- China has made economic reform a priority , allowing social changes when timing and conditions are right , in order to `` minimize shock ; '' b -RRB- China has been able to maintain a `` socialist structure '' under `` communist leadership ; '' and c -RRB- if reforms are well planned from the outset , they can take place gradually , as they are in China .
Kim points out that North Korea 's joint venture law offers foreigners more favorable terms than China 's law , and concludes by saying that `` North Korea could rise as a new star of the Far East , if reform is properly handled . ''
SISA also reports the views of Ho Mun-yong , a prominent researcher at the National Unification Research Institute , regarding North Korea 's outlook on China 's reforms .
Ho believes that Kim Il - song 's visit to China in 1982 , Kim Chong-il 's tour of the Shenzhen special economic zone in 1983 , and the enactment of the joint venture law in 1984 are indications that the DPRK is moving toward Chinese-style reforms .

Among the plan 's concrete aspects , MKS reports the ROK Government will `` greatly enlarge '' its `` Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund `` and the Export-Import Bank 's `` Deferred Payment Export Fund `` to `` expand the scale on which our companies will be able to provide important plants and facilities which China needs to move forward with its plans for economic development . ''
The paper reports that the former fund is supporting China investors this year with some $ 50 million , and that the figure will grow to $ 5 billion by 1996 .
At present , there are nine China -related deferred payment applications with a total value of $ 1.2 billion , according to the report .
MOTIE intends to `` accelerate '' this by making China `` the main target for deferred payment export financing . ''
MOTIE considers it `` urgent '' that South Korea build its own distribution network in China and is working on a plan to accomplish this , according to MKS .
The ministry aims to put a stop to `` South Korean companies ' indiscriminate investment in China , which has been lopsided by region , '' and will select `` business sectors in which China investment will be encouraged , '' by dropping , for example , the requirement for prior approval .
In the automotive sector , TONGA ILBO reports MOTIE wants to export finished cars to China , in addition to producing them locally .
The 19 February MKS reports on how South Korean conglomerates are gearing up for large investments in China in anticipation of government support for increased involvement .

China 's involvement on some level is being considered to facilitate overseas sales .
CHOSON ILBO notes similarly that MOTIE 's present plan is to invite only one foreign firm to participate in the plane 's development , but that it may bring in a third country , `` including possibly China , '' to facilitate marketing the aircraft .
Currently , steel firms import 4-5,000 tons of North Korean pig iron each year via China .
-LRB- Seoul HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN 13 Feb 94 p 4 -RRB- China 's Currency , Tax Reforms To Be 'Direct Blow ' to ROK Exports - China 's moves to unify its two currency system -LRB- renminbi and foreign exchange certificates -RRB- , adjust tariffs , raise the VAT , and impose a consumption tax will greatly weaken ROK export competitiveness in third country markets where ROK and Chinese goods compete .
The moves are also expected to be a `` direct blow '' to ROK exports into China .
China has devalued the yuan by 33.3 percent , fixed the VAT -LRB- which had varied between 8 and 15 percent depending on the type of good -RRB- at 17 percent , and set up a new consumption tax to restrain imports .
While China 's reform measures bring its trade system in line with international standards , they also seem to reveal China 's intention to curb imports .
The exchange rate adjustment and tax measures will act like a `` double trap '' to ROK exports to China .

There are market rumours that Chinese mines are at a standstill because Russia , previously the biggest consumer of the metal and which imported more than 5,000 tonnes a year from China , has stopped buying .
Mr Michael Maby , secretary-general of the association , said yesterday : 'On paper the market looks in balance but any increase in demand can be supplied by China very cheaply indeed ' .
They include China , the biggest producer , which represents over 60 per cent of world trade ; Russia , which ranks second in production ; and the three biggest importers , the US , Germany and Japan .
During the Geneva meeting , China reported falling exports of tungsten ores and concentrates in the first nine months of 1993 , while the US expected a 9 per cent drop in consumption this year after a 25 per cent fall in 1992 .
Today the ATPC faces its greatest challenge because after much persuasion China joined in April this year .
China agreed to limit its tin exports in 1994 to 20,000 tonnes .
The official China Daily reported at the beginning of this month that in the first half alone the country exported 24,700 tonnes , a 33 per cent increase on the same months of 1993 .
The China Daily also reported that the Chinese government would tighten up on tin exports in the second half of this year .
'China has said it will adhere to certain ATPC recommended limits on exports in previous years even though it has not been a member , but of course it has n't ' Mr Shaw suggests that , if it had not been for China 's exports of refined tin during the past few years , 'the stocks overhang which was left as a legacy of the collapse of the International Tin Council could have been more or less drawn down by now ' .
CRU 's Mr Madavo expects China 's refined tin exports to slow in the second half of this year but the 1994 total will probably exceed the 32,000 - 33,000 tonnes exported last year .
China also ships out tin in concentrate -LRB- an intermediate material -RRB- and , when this is taken into account , the export total could rise to 40,000 - 45,000 tonnes .

But the fact that London Transport - the premier urban transport operator in the country - had been thinking about street-running tramways in the early 1980s altered perceptions of the idea elsewhere in the country .
By the late 1980s , with construction underway on the Manchester system , cities and towns throughout the UK began to see the modern tram as the solution to their transport ills .
THE OPENING of the Manchester light rail system sees trams finally return to the streets of Britain 's great cities .
After the Second World War the notion of street-running of railway systems was seen as cumbersome and intrusive , and trams were replaced by motor buses in one city after another .
The opening of the new era of the tram in Britain can be dated to a 1982 report into the options for a new railway to regenerate the London Docklands .
They proposed a new light rail system for east London which would feature street running , including a stretch down the busy Mile End Road .
At the behest of the London Docklands Development Corporation , the new railway was built as a highly-visible automatic system , wholly-segregated from the streets on elevated track , with the aim of promoting the image of high-tech regeneration of the area .
By early 1990 , 50 UK towns either had firm plans or were considering proposals for a street-running light rail system , with towns as small as Gloucester and Chatham hankering after modern trams .
However , the government has indicated that the taxpayer can afford to start one new light rail project each year , so some of the larger UK cities now have a real chance of regaining their trams .
Next in the queue is Birmingham , which has ambitious plans for a light rail network extending to 200km .
Detailed planning is underway on the first 21km route , which will use an old railway alignment between the centre of Birmingham and Wolverhampton - 1995 is the best bet for an opening date .
One hurdle to be jumped is the Pounds 140m cost : with so much Treasury money going into the conventional railway system in London , there is a strong predisposition in Whitehall to favour provincial light rail schemes in preference to any in the capital .
Nottingham 's proposal is interesting in that it could provide the first example in Britain of light rail vehicles -LRB- modern trams -RRB- intermingling with British Rail trains on the same track - an idea which has been shunned on safety grounds so far , but which modern signalling systems could make feasible .
The practice is being pioneered in Karlsruhe , Germany , where light rail vehicles already run on German Railways tracks .
One scheme that was a frontrunner in the British light rail race - but has slipped behind - is Bristol 's Avon Metro .
There is more realism in the British light rail movement about the chances of getting projects built than there was a couple of years ago - and the industry is now maturing beyond 'the flavour of the month ' into a rational answer to urban transport problems .
THE government may privatise London 's Docklands Light Railway by paying the private sector to take it over .
Government advisers are studying the move as one of the most likely options for getting the loss-making railway into private ownership .
The government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the private sector to build a Pounds 130m extension of the Docklands Light Railway across the Thames to Lewisham in south-east London .
A straightforward sale or stock-market flotation of the railway is ruled out by the losses it makes , currently more than five times its Pounds 3m annual revenues .
But Ernst & Young believes the private sector could be offered a 'dowry ' to take the railway off the government 's hands .
Another option would be to franchise the operation of the railway to the company wanting the smallest subsidy to run it .
The railway 's performance , once notoriously unreliable , has improved sharply in the past few months under a new management team headed by Sir Peter Levene , former head of defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence .
Last week , Sir Peter announced that the railway was to pay Brown & Root , the US engineering group , Pounds 30m over the next three years to get the railway running smoothly and cut its costs .
Mr Eric Anstey , Ernst & Young 's director of privatisation and utilities services , said the railway could become profitable next decade if the property market recovered and the Lewisham extension was built .
For the past eight months the automatic , driverless trains of London 's Docklands Light Railway have been shuttling along a new five-mile extension to the suburb of Beckton .
The trains have been operating without passengers as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested .
This was partly because it was designed when Docklands was still planned as an area of housing and light industry and before the building of Canary Wharf turned it into a high-rise office centre .
The Beckton extension will bring a large part of east London within easy reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the City airport .
In a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled Docklands development , there will still be no station in the airport terminal .
Mr Hutchinson and his team of managers , recruited in November 1991 from the procurement department of the Ministry of Defence , believe they will bring about a rehabilitation of the railway 's image and a period of rapid expansion .
The second significant improvement should come in the summer when painstaking work to modernise signalling will be completed and the railway will be open in the evenings and at weekends , making it much more attractive to local workers and accessible for tourists .
By the end of this year the DLR expects to choose a private consortium to carry out a Pounds 100m extension of the railway across the Thames .
The Lewisham spur is due to be completed by 1997 , the year before the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension provides a direct underground link between Docklands and the West End of London .
The Jubilee Line extension will increase the attractions of Docklands for office developers , but will at the same time steal many of the DLR 's customers who now come out from the City .

On that first night -- warm , muggy Aug. 9 , 1969 -- Manson followers Susan Atkins , 21 ; Patricia Krenwinkel , 21 , and Charles -LRB- Tex -RRB- Watson , 23 , invaded the Benedict Canyon home leased by Tate and her husband , film director Roman Polanski , and killed the 27-year-old actress , who was 8 1/2 months pregnant .
He has a few minutes to arrange his papers for the latest in nearly 20 years of confrontations with Charles Milles Manson , mastermind of the peculiarly unforgettable mass murders that badly rattled California in August of 1969 .
Manson , led from his single cell in San Quentin 's Security Housing Unit , has waived his right to an attorney .
He is long past trying to ingratiate himself with the three -man Board of Prison Terms panel that will decide whether to grant him a future parole date .
Manson reaches the door behind which the hearing officers and Kay wait with two `` pool `` reporters and two television cameras .
New American Library late this year is publishing an updated edition of Ed Sanders ' 1972 book , `` The Family : The Story of Charles Manson 's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion . ''
At the Vacaville facility in 1981 , Manson warned Kay that he would be killed in the parking lot after the hearing .
At Manson 's 1986 evaluation , Kay asked why Manson spends hours in his cell constructing scorpions out of thread from his socks .
Manson , the razor-sliced swastika in his forehead emphasized in blue-black ink , took the bait .
`` From the world of darkness I did loose demons and devils in the power of scorpions to torment , '' he announced .
This year , a moment before he is to enter the hearing room , Manson abruptly decides that he is having none of this legally mandated but manifestly futile ritual .
With Manson in absentia for the third time in his nine hearings , Stephen Kay , a 22-year veteran at the D.A. 's
Kay has been making these arguments for 11 years , ever since Manson , Susan -LRB- Sadie Mae Glutz -RRB- Atkins , Charles -LRB- Tex -RRB- Watson , Patricia -LRB- Katie -RRB- Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten first became eligible for parole .
The trial was a combination of fascination and revulsion , like a snake with its tail in its mouth .
SHARON TATE WAS 26 , a classically beautiful but not quite top-rank movie actress eight and a half months pregnant , when a dark-clad band on a mission from Manson invaded the Benedict Canyon estate she and her film-director husband , Roman Polanski , were renting .
A previous tenant there , Terry Melcher , the record- producer son of actress Doris Day , had snubbed Manson and his musical ambitions a year earlier .
The following night , after the sensational celebrity murders failed to trigger the black-white race war Manson had prophesied from his dark reading of Revelations and the Beatles ' `` Helter Skelter `` during long group LSD sessions , Manson himself entered the Los Feliz home of Leno LaBianca , owner of a small supermarket chain .
Prominent as some of the victims were , Manson immediately surpassed them in public interest .
Kay recalls , `` With his picture on the cover of Life magazine -- that stare -- Manson was like everybody 's Freddy . ''
Here was a man , prefiguring Jim Jones in the Guyana jungle , with the mysterious power to command others to kill for him , even to dispatch themselves to the gas chamber by taking all the blame at trial and attempting to exculpate the leader they sincerely regarded as both Jesus and the devil .
Manson has effectively surrendered , but the others are fighting seriously for freedom , using skilled lawyers .
The social rebellion of the '60s was carried to a horrible extreme in the depredations of Manson and his dropout `` family `` of acid habituees .
Kay says he handled `` even more gruesome '' murder cases in 14 years as a trial prosecutor , notably the 1980-81 trial of Lawrence Bittaker , who with a companion taped the prolonged torture of one of five teen-age girls they kidnaped .
Kay considers Manson 's murders worse , different in kind .
Of the eight Manson `` family `` members convicted in the nine murders that law enforcement was able to establish , only one , Steve -LRB- Clem Tufts -RRB- Grogan , has been paroled .
He profited from showing the authorities where Shea 's previously undiscovered remains were buried near the Spahn Ranch , Manson 's dusty Chatsworth base .
AT SAN QUENTIN , a month before Manson is transferred to the new maximum-security Corcoran facility in the San Joaquin Valley , Kay 's argument runs 27 minutes .
Atkins , Manson and 22 others coincidentally had been rounded up in mid-October at their Death Valley retreat and booked for unrelated arson and auto thefts .
Kay tells the board that Manson has `` a serious and severe personality disorder , '' although the prison psychologist 's latest report maintained that Manson `` is not psychotic and probably never was and never will be . ''
`` Mr. Manson remains locked in an Armageddon with society , '' he tells the somber commissioners , as if summing up to a jury hooked on TV courtroom drama .
Society has a slim advantage now because we have Manson behind bars .
Manson is probably the best advertisement that California ever had for the death penalty , because , frankly , as long as Mr. Manson is alive , he is a great danger . ''
Minutes later , the board votes Manson another three-year denial .
As Kay likes to point out in lectures around the state to explain why he keeps pushing when it seems implausible that Manson will ever be freed , Charlie does remain a role model of sorts to a fringe of satanists , neo-Nazis and skinheads , just as Adolf Hitler remains a hero for him .
Manson gets a fair number of letters and gifts from young people who idolize him as the ultimate outsider .
Outside the prison gate during the hearing , two young San Francisco men in black paramilitary uniforms , accompanied by three women , carry signs supporting Manson .
Kay was a boyish 27 , three years out of Berkeley 's Boalt Hall Law School , when Bugliosi was keeping him and Donald Musich on short leashes as his muffled assistants in the long first trial , its singsong craziness one of the strangest courtroom spectacles grown from the '60s .
Of all the figures in the story , only Kay has stayed with the Manson case -- unless , with some irony , one counts his elected boss since 1984 , District Attorney Ira Reiner .
As a private lawyer , Reiner lobbied Manson for a place on the high-profile defense team .
Reiner represented Van Houten for eight early months but proved too independent-minded for Manson , who persuaded Van Houten to fire him .
Kay went on to prosecute Bruce Davis , an accomplice of Manson and Grogan , to a life sentence for the Shea murder .
Reinforced by Dino Fulgoni , the office expert on the since-outlawed `` diminished capacity '' defense , Kay recovered with a 1978 third- trial guilty verdict .
When Lynette -LRB- Squeaky -RRB- Fromme aimed a pistol at President Ford in Sacramento in 1975 , Kay confidently told reporters that Manson had ordered the assault -- a theory never established .
Notified within 90 minutes and fearing that Fromme was heading west specifically to kill him out of devotion to Manson , Kay got himself what he calls `` added security '' until the prattling little redheaded woman was caught near the prison two days later .
For the past seven months he has been one of two assistant directors supervising personnel assignments and policy decisions for the department 's branch offices in Van Nuys , Santa Monica , Torrance , Long Beach , Compton , Beverly Hills and Inglewood .
He prepares for the sessions as if there were an imminent prospect of the concededly shattered Manson group reuniting for its predawn `` creepy-crawl '' missions .
If Kay respects any of these convicts , it is Manson .
`` Manson 's just himself , '' he says .
`` It 's an attempt by him to grab the limelight , '' says Paul Fitzgerald , who represented Krenwinkel at trial and Van Houten at early parole hearings .
Consistently underestimated by the Friends of Leslie support group , Kay has been trumping them in a long fight that he has smoothly escalated from the administrative arena of pine-paneled hearing rooms to the public forum of mass media appearances and nationwide petition drives .
CHARLES MANSON , born illegitimate in Cincinnati , was placed by an uncaring mother with a series of foster parents .
On parole , Manson gravitated to San Francisco 's pulsating Haight-Ashbury district .
In contrast to Manson and his raggedy gang of 25 hard-core members and 60 `` associates , '' Stephen Kay has never experienced anything but mainstream stability .
-LRB- Kay wanted to write a book on the Bittaker trial with his mother , but unlike Bugliosi he dropped his book idea , claiming that publishers demanded too much gore . -RRB-
Twelve years later Sandy Good was wearing an X on her forehead and Kay was cross-examining her at the Manson trial -- during which , he says , she and Fromme cruised up on both sides of him and threatened `` to do to your house what was done to Sharon Tate 's house . ''
Not originally assigned to the Manson trial , he read the start of Linda Kasabian 's hair-raising 17 days of turncoat testimony when he was in a Northern California coffee shop on a vacation drive to Canada .
Then , District Attorney Evelle Younger kicked chief trial deputy Aaron Stovitz off the case for violating an order against news comments .
`` Little did I know when I got back from vacation , '' says Kay , `` that in 1989 I 'd still be talking about this case . ''
system of a luxury New York department store a few months after Manson 's arrest .
`` It captured everybody 's imagination in our generation , '' says Krenwinkel 's trial lawyer Paul Fitzgerald , now 51 .
`` Average people do not believe there is the type of human being like Manson , '' says Musich .
`` Of course , '' he says , `` you ca n't close the book on the Manson phenomenon without saying something about LSD .
Manson , says West , `` was one of many types of predators drawn to the essential defenselessness of these young and often idealistic people who were exceptionally vulnerable , anyway , and even more vulnerable because of their drug use . ''
`` It could happen again , '' West recognizes , defining the Manson group as a `` totalist cult . ''
Manson 's followers , says West , were enthralled by their leader 's race-war delusions not only because of impairment by drugs but because of the group 's twisted internal dynamics .
Still disagreeing that Manson 's soldiers were infected with a dose of slavish obedience by one dominant man 's bizarre philosophizing , Kay blames neither society nor the '60s in relying on his old courtroom argument for a conspiracy of equally hate-filled renegades .
`` The Manson clan , '' says Kay , `` was a group of misfits that just came together kind of at the wrong place and the wrong time .
You had hippie communes and peace marchers , but you never had the violence and lust for murder that were demonstrated by Manson and the family . ''
`` When Sharon was begging for her life , '' she asks , `` what compassion did Watson and Susan Atkins give to her ?
After all this time , mention of the Tate-La Bianca case evokes in untold thousands the shocking memories of two nights of horror in Los Angeles 20 years ago when Manson Family cultists savagely murdered seven people , including beautiful , honey -blonde actress Sharon Tate .
Acting on Manson 's orders again the next night , follower Leslie Van Houten , 20 , joined Watson and Krenwinkel in the murder of grocery executive Leno La Bianca , 44 , and his wife , Rosemary , 38 , in Los Feliz , a few miles away .
Did Manson , who had spent nearly half his life in jail , really expect to fulfill his vision of Armageddon -- based on the lyrics of a Beatles song -- by starting a black-white race war , as suggested by his prosecutor , Deputy Dist .
Or , possibly Manson 's own mental illness , as others have speculated ?
Those who knew him then say Manson taught that all people are God , Jesus Christ and the devil -- part of a whole -- and as such , there is no right , no wrong , no good or bad , no barrier to action , and that death , time and pain are only concepts .
But , according to others , life at the make-believe world of Spahn Movie Ranch in the Santa Susana Pass , where the Manson Family settled in late 1968 , was n't all that magical .
Manson handed out LSD , directed group sex and sent his followers to steal , later to kill .
To retired Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older , 71 , who presided at the trial , Manson 's `` twisted philosophy '' supplied direction to people without it .
Manson and his co-defendants were all sentenced to death , but were spared when the state Supreme Court overturned capital punishment , which has since been reinstated .
Manson , now 54 , and the others have repeatedly sought parole from their life prison sentences without success .

Though all the host countries had cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with Beijing , and undertaken to adopt the `` one China `` policy , President Ramos , President Suharto , and King of Thailand Phumiphon went so far as to ignore Beijing 's objection and insisted on meeting with Li Teng-hui , making Beijing very frustrated .
Informed sources said that a recent `` restricted publication '' circulating among high-ranking cadres ran a commentary on Li Teng- hui 's `` holiday diplomacy . ''
This commentary believes that Li Teng- hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' is a materialization of Taiwan 's `` southward policy '' -LRB- formulated to encourage Taiwan businessmen making investments in the mainland to channel their funds to Southeast Asia , in a bid to break the mainland 's blockade with economy as an open sesame and expand Taiwan 's diplomatic space -RRB- and an implementation of the `` wild geese formation theory '' -LRB- a Japanese economist 's theory highly recommended by Li Teng-hui , which maps out an Asian economic scenario with Japan , the most advanced country , in the lead , followed by the `` four little dragons '' and then Southeast Asian countries , with the Chinese mainland and North Korea taking up the rear -RRB- .
This effort made possible the instant success of Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' during the Spring Festival season , which fulfilled the purpose of `` killing three birds with one stone : '' It expanded headroom for Taiwan 's diplomatic activities in the international arena , opened up new prospects for Taiwan business investment and development , and reduced Taiwan business dependence on the mainland market to prevent the increase of such dependence that might put Taiwan authorities in a passive position politically .
The sources continued : The CPC authorities showed grave concern over Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' from the very beginning .
If the governments of the countries that have diplomatic relations with China accept Li Teng-hui 's visit , regardless of the capacity and way in which this visit will be made , it will severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and impair the friendly and cooperative relations the countries concerned have maintained with China .
There are political personalities in both the United States and Japan saying that Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' is acceptable .
The sources also said : Because Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' came to the fore after Beijing took the initiative to give in and make it possible for the `` Tang-Chiao meeting '' to reach an understanding , the CPC finds itself in a state of attending to one thing while losing sight of another and feels that it has been misled by the `` Tang-Chiao meeting . ''
Furthermore , the three countries playing host to Li Teng-hui went so far as to go their own way and ignore Beijing 's objection , which has deeply convinced the CPC authorities that they can not change the predicament they are in if they fail to break `` holiday diplomacy . ''
Some think tanks based in big cities , such as the Institute for International Strategic Studies , have recently recommended tactics for dealing with Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy , '' including short-term and long-term actions .
It is believed that the shock caused by Li Teng-hui 's `` holiday diplomacy '' will spur the CPC to further review its new tactics for reunification .
An informed source told our correspondent that Li Teng-hui 's visit resulted from mediation by Gu Liansong , who has close relations with the Thai - Chinese business community and once was chairman of the Taiwan - Thai Business Committee and advisor to Taiwan 's Executive Branch .
Meanwhile , a Chinese National People 's Congress -LSB- NPC -RSB- delegation led by Zhu Liang , chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee , may delay or cancel its visit to Thailand as a result of Li Teng-hui 's visit .
According to a Taiwan official source , Li Teng-hui hopes to drink `` coffee '' and meet informally with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai after the luncheon .
The deputy prime minister and Li Teng-hui also had an informal luncheon meeting on the boat .
Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo expressed confidence yesterday China 's protest over the meeting between President Ramos and his Taiwanese counterpart , Li Teng-hui , will not harm long-term RP -LSB- Republic of the Philippines -RSB- - China bond .
He denied that the meeting between Deputy Prime minister and Li Teng-hui was official , adding that the two did not discuss politics or economics .
To use President Li Teng-hui 's own phrase , the KMT is `` re-opening an old store . ''
Ranged on one side are Mr Lee 's supporters , the liberal mainstream faction , most of whom are native Taiwanese and who favour direct presidential elections .
Ramos was also able to verify the date for the construction work to begin in the Taiwanese industrial zone within the Subic Bay .

Host Countries Ignore China 's Objection
Squadron Leader Prasong said the Taiwanese president arranged the trip to Thailand through the private sector and that there were no plans for him to meet Prime Minister Chuan Likphai or other Cabinet ministers .
`` They -LSB- the Taiwanese -RSB- contacted the private sector , '' he said .
According to informed sources , the Taiwanese president is accompanied by First Lady Cheng Wen -hui .
The Taiwanese president flew to Bandung in West Java on Thursday where he played golf and visited the state-owned Nusantara National Aircraft Industry -LRB- IPTN -RRB- accompanied by its president , Research and Technology Minister Bacharudin Jusuf Habibie .
The Taiwanese president will stay at the Pacific Island Club Hotel , where Amnuai will host a dinner reception for him tonight , the source said .
Indonesia does not appear to pay much attention to China , as evidenced by the reception accorded by President Suharto to the Taiwanese president .
By contrast , the Thai Government will not have any official part in the Taiwanese president 's visit .
On behalf of the Thai Government , Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri stated that Thailand firmly maintained the `` One China `` policy and that the government had nothing to do with the Taiwanese president 's visit .
However , taking into account the national interests , there is no reason for Thailand to neglect economic relations which could grow as result of the Taiwanese president 's private visit .
The invitation was extended to the Taiwanese president by the Thai private sector , and the visit was , therefore , not recognized by the government .
Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that no Thai cabinet ministers would meet the Taiwanese president either in their official or private capacities .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- Asked if there was any possibility of the Taiwanese president discussing economic issues with economic ministers , Sqn .
The spokesman said there was substantial business activity between Thais and Taiwanese , and that a large number of Thais were working in Taiwan .
The daily JAKARTA POST said that Taiwanese Presidential Office spokesman Kramer Ting told journalists that Li and Suharto agreed that Indonesia and Taiwan should improve economic cooperation .
Suharto also expressed appreciation for Taiwanese investment in Indonesia , the spokesman said .
Asked to comment on the PRC Government 's dissatisfaction with countries who have welcomed the Taiwan president , Phaithun said that the Chinese Government should understand this issue well because China itself recognizes Taiwanese investment .
-LSB- Phaithun -RSB- Mainland China itself recognizes Taiwanese investment .
Philippine defense officials have held `` secret '' meetings with their Taiwanese counterparts over the acquisition of 12 F-5E fighters Taiwan plans to discard once it acquires French-made Mirage fighters , a senior defense official said Thursday -LSB- 17 February -RSB- .
The note was issued after the Taiwanese president 's visit to Thailand , which took place between 14 and 16 February during which the Thai Government organized a reception in Phuket .
The Thai Government , however , viewed the Taiwanese president 's visit as private to `` rest for three days to play golf . ''
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters that Thailand firmly abided by its one - China policy and that the Taiwanese president 's visit would not affect that policy .
In any event , it was reported that on 16 February the king hosted a dinner for the Taiwanese president at Phuphing Palace , Chiang Mai Province .
`` Everybody who is not persona non grata has the right to enter Thailand , just as the Dalai Lama has done , '' Chuan said his strongest statement yet on the Taiwanese president 's visit .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- The prime minister said there was no agreement between Thailand and China to bar an unofficial visit by a Taiwanese president .
Thailand and Taiwan have trade ties , and Taiwanese businessmen are the third largest investors here , second to Japan and the United States .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- Elsewhere in Asean or the Indochinese states newly recovered from wars and needing massive foreign investment , Taiwanese businessmen always come in force and are invariably given a warm welcome .
At this point no country , not even the United States , which helped separate the Korean peninsula , would put money on the Taiwanese side .
In the Philippines , Taiwanese businessmen are keen to turn Subic Bay into an industrial zone , while Indonesia and Taiwanese investors are planning to build an aircraft factory in Bundung .
A senior official said the visit to Thailand was a gain for the Taiwanese .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- It is true Taiwanese investment in Thailand appears to have reached the saturation point .
The choice of the Philippines and Indonesia as the first two stops shows where the priorities of Taiwanese investors lie .
Board of Investment figures show that Taiwanese investment here has dropped from Bt -LSB- baht -RSB- 6.4 billion in 1991 to Bt5.96 billion in 1993 .
Moreover , even if Taiwanese investment has peaked in Thailand itself , there is plenty of opportunity for the Taiwanese to play a key part in the newborn Growth Quadrangle and the yet-to-take off triangular economic cooperation involving Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia .
When non- Taiwanese Provincial Governor Sung Ch 'u-yu -LSB- 1345 2806 2404 , James Soong -RSB- delivered his remarks , he spoke quite a bit of Taiwanese .
He expressed the hope that all Taiwanese will further develop this spirit , and strive for even more glorious achievements .
Invited to deliver remarks at that meeting , professor P'eng Ming -min -LSB- 1756 2494 2404 -RSB- , noting that Taiwan had relations with Mainland China in only four out the past 100 years , called upon all Taiwanese to sever any emotional ties to China and strive to achieve the dream of a Taiwan that is stable , prosperous , and democratic , with freedom and respect for human rights .
Why is it that for the first time in 21 years a non- Taiwanese was appointed Governor ?
Why is it that this non-native Governor spoke in Taiwanese ?
Why is it that in establishing the `` Taiwan People 's Federation , '' no attempt was made to sort out the non- Taiwanese from among the sponsors and supporters ?
The issue of reunification versus independence is still to be fully debated , but on Taiwanese soil , the cries of `` Taiwan , Taiwan ! ''
THE Taiwanese National Assembly faces a week-long boycott by opposition delegates as the latest sign of growing discord on the island about whether to move to a directly elected presidency - a debate which itself is symptomatic of uncertainty about Taiwan 's broader constitutional future .
Opinion polls earlier this year showed that a majority of Taiwanese favoured direct election of the president , if only because it was simpler than other methods .
Conservatives in the KMT also argue that direct election of a Taiwanese president would be a step closer to formal independence , and therefore unacceptable to Beijing , which has threatened military intervention should the island declare itself independent .
Although most Taiwanese support the existing state of de facto independence , the campaign frightened people who believe China 's threat to use military force to reunify Taiwan if it seeks formal independence .
According to opinion polls , most Taiwanese are happy with their present state of de facto independence and would welcome eventual reunification with a democratic China .
But younger Taiwanese are less sure and are frustrated by Taiwan 's lack of international recognition .
Taiwanese also resent the continuing grip on power held by descendants of mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 but make up less than 15 per cent of the population .
'The line between Taiwanese and mainlanders is still very clear , ' said Mr Lin Yu-siong , a Taiwanese KMT legislator .
This , broadly speaking , pits conservative mainlanders against more liberal Taiwanese party members .
Although the Taiwanese are sure they do not want reunification with a communist China , they are uncertain how to improve the relationship without radical changes in China 's ideological position .
But it has been criticised for being hastily drawn up and likely to add to inflation , which is heading for 4 - 5 per cent - high by Taiwanese standards .
After registering almost no growth in 1990 , exports have recovered , helped by a stable new Taiwanese dollar and increasing exports to China .
Exports to newly-built Taiwanese factories in China helped lift total trade with China 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn in the first seven months of this year .
Even if China agreed to modify its non-recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty , Taiwan may delay lifting the three bans to squeeze further concessions from China at a later stage .
During 1992 , more than 1.5m Taiwanese visited China , via a third country .
In addition , a lobby of senior Taiwanese bankers were invited by Beijing to set up branches in the mainland , but this request was turned down by the Taiwanese government .
Ironically Mr Y F Chang , Evergreen 's founder and chairman , is an avowed supporter of the opposition Democratic Progressive party , which endorses Taiwanese independence - an event which many still believe would trigger a Chinese invasion .
This now pits 'a Taiwanese KMT against a Taiwanese DPP , ' says Mr Huang .
'Many voters forgive him for everything as he 's the first Taiwanese president , but his dictatorial ways wo n't be tolerated forever , ' Mr Chao says .
After seven years ' detente , the paper comes amid a sharp escalation in cross-strait tensions since the March 31 deaths of 24 Taiwanese tourists in China 's Zhejiang Province .
While Taiwan business backs closer ties with China , most Taiwanese remain profoundly distrustful of Beijing 's leaders .
A government -commissioned survey in late June found 12 per cent of Taiwanese support independence , 21 per cent support reunification , and 56 per cent prefer to maintain the status quo .
Another reason not go is that Mr Murayama risks offending the Taiwanese by being in Beijing on October 10 , Taiwan 's politically sensitive national day .

In Waco , the blaze left the cult compound a smouldering ruin - a grim testimony to Mr Koresh 's claims to be a new Messiah come to warn the world that its end was near .
In the eyes of FBI spokesman Ricks , mass suicide was what Koresh wanted all along .
The FBI said it believed Mr Koresh ordered a mass suicide and that there had been 'massive loss of life ' .
Mr Koresh and all but nine of his followers were presumed dead .
One survivor was quoted as saying that , after the fires were lit , Mr Koresh advised his followers to 'relax ' because they would soon be seeing 'the face of God ' .
Only last week Mr Koresh warned FBI agents that they would be 'devoured ' by fire if they tried to harm him .
At the weekend Mr Koresh requested a word processor to enable him to record his revelations .
Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be inside the compound with Mr Koresh and his followers .
Mr Koresh last week disappointed federal agents by failing to surrender on weapons and other charges resulting from the raid , which left four agents dead , that began the stand-off .
Over the weekend Mr Koresh sent a request for a word processor to enable him to record his revelations .
Fresh material given to Panorama , a taped conversation between cult-leader David Koresh and his lawyer late in the siege , suggests that Koresh did not want mass-suicide .
Koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the revelations of the Twelfth Seal .
This the FBI dismissed as mere bluff , so Koresh 's deadline was literally that .
In a typically grandstanding address , he said he thought she should have tendered her resignation because of the Waco debacle , in which over 80 cult members died .
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday reaffirmed his confidence in Ms Janet Reno , US attorney-general , and said he had no intention of asking her to resign because of the tragic ending to the siege of a religious cult at Waco , Texas .
Mr Clinton said he took full responsibility for the government 's actions on Monday , when more than 80 cult members died in flames after Federal Bureau of Investigation officials had started to pour teargas into the buildings which the cult 's adherents were occupying .
US Attorney General Janet Reno said last night she asked 'question after question ' before giving the go-ahead for the FBI action which ended in the fiery suicide of religious cult members in Waco , Texas .
The deaths confronted Ms Reno with a crisis just a month after being sworn in as the first woman attorney general in the US .
The crisis appeared to set the seal on the expected replacement of the embattled FBI director , Mr William Sessions .
Ms Reno said the FBI plan had been part of a 'coherent and continuing ' effort to bring a peaceful end to the 51-day siege of the cult group 's compound .
There may be questions about whether the FBI 's moves to ram holes in the religious group 's bunker and to throw tear gas into the holes were not an attempt to do more than shrink the perimeter of the compound .
If 'today was not to be the day ' for final action - as Ms Reno indicated to the press - but just an attempt to force the cult members into an ever smaller area , this appeared hard to reconcile with the broadcasting of directions over a loudspeaker about how to surrender .
The FBI spokesman , Mr Bob Ricks said : 'Our desire was to get them out of there in a non-lethal , systematic manner . '
The FBI had acted with bravery , even refusing to return fire coming from the cult members , he said .
One FBI agent even left his vehicle to grab a burning woman and take her , against her will , to safety .
The FBI 's tear gas had 'absolutely nothing to do with the suicide , ' he said .
It was the cult leader , who gave the order to commit suicide .
He wanted to kill some FBI people first . '
EIGHT-SIX people were feared to have died in an apparent mass suicide yesterday when the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian religious cult near Waco , Texas , ended in an inferno , writes Nancy Dunne in Washington .
The FBI said that among the nine survivors were an Australian and two of the 26 Britons believed by the Foreign Office to have been in the compound .
Attorney-general Janet Reno , who took responsibility for the FBI action , last night said the plan to move against the compound had appeared the best way to end the stand-off without bloodshed .
She absolved President Clinton of blame , saying he knew only generally of the plan , and added that the FBI had 'acted professionally and with remarkable restraint ' .
The blaze spread swiftly , punctuated by explosions - possibly from the cult 's ammunition stores .
It started several hours after the FBI rammed the compound with tanks and fired tear- gas in an attempt to end the siege .
By the time firemen arrived little was left of the cult 's large compound .
The incident appeared to echo the 1978 Jonestown massacre , where more than 800 people died in a mass suicide at a cult centre in the jungles of Guyana .
The charges resulted from a raid to confiscate weapons from the cult .
The raid began the stand-off and left four agents and several cult followers dead .
But the FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound .
THE 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian religious cult near Waco , Texas , ended in an inferno yesterday following an attempt by US law enforcement agents to halt the stand-off .
The White House said FBI agents were doing everything possible to rescue the 95 cult followers from the compound and that at least 20 people had left .
'They 're still pulling people out , ' a White House official said , adding that the FBI did not know how many would survive the fire .
FBI agents pulled out of the compound one reluctant woman who did not want to leave .
The blaze , which razed all the buildings in the compound , prompted fears that the cult may have embarked on either a mass escape through tunnels or mass suicide several hours after the FBI fired teargas at them in an attempt to end the siege .
talk to the attorney-general or the FBI .
The blaze spread swiftly , punctuated by explosions - possibly from the cult 's vast ammunition stores .
The FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
Mr Bob Ricks , the FBI agent in charge of the operation , said the teargas was fired to 'make them as uncomfortable as possible ' .
Anything but clear , as we were reminded by Panorama ; Sinful Messiah -LRB- BBC 1 , Monday -RRB- is whether the FBI were justified in mounting the assault on the Branch Davidian headquarters .

These species died off at the end of the Jurassic , to be replaced by small dinosaurs that evolved into the iguana-like iguanodons , the dome -headed dinosaurs and the largest land-based predator ever to exist , Tyrannosaurus rex -- all of which were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago .
`` This dramatic change in the evolutionary cast of characters -LRB- between the Jurassic and Cretaceous -RRB- is one of the most profound crises in dinosaur development , '' Bakker said .
The fossil bed indicates that the region was swampy and fern-choked at the end of the Jurassic .
Similar conditions prevailed at the end of the Cretaceous and at the end of the Permian period 250 million years ago , when another extinction occurred before dinosaurs existed .
But , noted geologist Walter Alvarez of UC Berkeley , there is `` overwhelming evidence '' that a cometary impact did occur at the end of the Cretaceous period .
The fossil strata also show that while large land animals died off , smaller aquatic species and reptiles did not .
Neither did the turtles .
In fact , the whole aquatic ecosystem bloomed and did fine .

Former U.S. President Richard Nixon died of a major stroke at 2108 -LRB- EST -RRB- today at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center at the age of 81 , reports reaching here said .
In November 1972 he was re-elected U.S. president until 9 August 1974 , when he was forced to resign in culmination of the Watergate scandal , thus becoming the only president in U.S. history to resign to avoid impeachment .
The former U.S. leader visited China in February 1972 and at the end of his visit , the Chinese and U.S. Governments issued the famous `` Shanghai Communique , '' opening the door to Sino-U.S. exchanges .
Today the U.S. Embassy was filled with a solemn silence .
He appeared at a welcoming banquet on the evening of February 21 , 1972 , and delivered a speech on behalf of the U.S. Government and the American people .
He was reelected president in 1972 , but was forced to resign and leave the White House in 1974 because of his involvement in the `` Watergate Affair . ''
In February 1972 , he and Premier Zhou Enlai signed a joint communique in Shanghai , thus opening the door to U.S. - Chinese relations .
In the last book he wrote , he said : `` Today , China 's economic power makes U.S. lectures about human rights imprudent .
In February 1976 , he revisited China as an ordinary citizen .
Although China 's strength in those days was much less impressive than it is today , China still resolutely and indomitably resisted and withstood strong external pressure .
Yu Xiaosong , vice minister of China 's State Economic and Trade Commission , said today that he is optimistic about the extension by the United States of most-favored-nation -LSB- MFN -RSB- status for China .
In reply to a reporter 's question about the U.S. extension of MFN status for China , Yu Xiaosong -- who was attending a Beijing - Hong Kong economy and trade luncheon meeting -- said today that he was optimistic about the extension .
Then why should something be done to deadlock the relations today ? he asked .
If the ideological differences on human rights today lead to a retrogression in Sino-U.S. ties , it will be an adverse current in history .
If we had failed to adopt resolute measures five years ago , the steady situation in China today would be impossible .

But Hanoi - where northern Vietnamese remember Mr Nixon as the man whose bombers pounded them in 1972 during the Vietnam War - officially closed its account with Mr Nixon with a terse five -word statement .

One hundred years ago today , a bearded , one -eyed Civil War hero , erstwhile free love advocate and `` Bible communist `` by the name of James William Towner presided over the creation of Orange County , now a national symbol of American conservatism .
The journey from Towner 's Orange County with its 13,000 rural residents to the exploding 2-million -strong exurbanite center of today has not been a simple one , but there are some continuous , if quirky , lines to be followed .
And , as is still true today , when their hamlets grew too large , they moved further away from Los Angeles to even more rural residences .
In a recent interview , Raymond Watson , Irvine Co. vice chairman , mentioned the klan legacy as a reason that blacks were not attracted to Orange County at the time he helped create the city of Irvine in the early 1970s .

In a `` no-holds-barred exchange , '' Richard M. Nixon today told Deng Xiaoping that some Chinese leaders have lost respect in the United States , and Deng accused Washington of involvement in the democracy movement that China 's army crushed in June .
`` As a result , '' he said , `` some Chinese now exhibit a distrust of the United States that is reminiscent of the period before 1972 .
We must not permit our real enemies -- misunderstanding , fruitless resentment , endless recrimination -- to close the door we opened with such high hopes 17 years ago . ''
Nixon , who is to leave China today after a six-day visit , said that after 20 hours of `` frank and wide-ranging '' discussions with Chinese leaders , he still can not say with certainty whether China will continue to move forward with reforms or whether it will again close its doors and `` revert to the stagnant situation that existed before . ''
For Nixon at least , the visit was a small replica of his diplomatic master stroke 17 years ago , when in a sense he gambled his own presidency on a trip to China and began the opening that would change the face of world politics .
Richard Nixon 's grand diplomacy of 1972 may account for his enduring stature as politician and President , but it is not a feat anyone , not even the master himself , is going to repeat .
China and United the States Are Still Deadlocked on the Human Rights Issue After winding up his trip to Beijing , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher left Beijing to visit Russia .
During his short visit to China , Christopher again applied pressure on the human rights issue , but China remained tough .
`` Nixon is an old friend of the Chinese people .
`` We hope Mr. Nixon will recover soon , '' she said .
Nixon has since maintained close contacts with China , visiting the country several times .
Nixon suffered a major stroke at his New Jersey home at around supper time on April 18 , and he was soon rushed to the hospital .
Beginning Thursday -LSB- 21 April -RSB- afternoon , Nixon lapsed into a very deep coma .
In 1968 , Nixon was elected president of the United States over Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent George Wallace and on 20 January 1969 , he was sworn in as the 37th president of the country .
Beginning this evening , flags in the capital Washington and the rest of the United States will fly at half -mast for 30 days to mourn Nixon 's death .
A Chinese delegation led by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited the U.S. Embassy Wednesday to pay its respects to former U.S. President Richard Nixon who died last week .
Qian , who is also vice-premier , and Luo Gan , secretary-general of the State Council , observed a moment 's silence in front of a picture of Nixon hanging in the dining room of the U.S. ambassador 's residence .
`` Nixon , when he was president of the United States , opened the door to Sino - US relations and made a valuable historical contribution .
Luo wrote a similar message , expressing his sympathy for Nixon 's relatives .
Wreaths `` expressing deep condolences '' from President Jiang Zemin , Premier Li Peng and vice premier in charge of the economy Zhu Rongji , surrounded the Nixon portrait .
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen offered his condolences here this morning on the unfortunate death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon , who made important contributions to the improvement and growth of Sino-U.S. ties .
A portrait of Nixon draped with black gauze was hung on the wall in the hall .
Qian and Luo slowly walked into the embassy and shook hands with U.S. Ambassador to China J. Stapleton Roy , expressing their deep condolences on Nixon 's death .
Qian 's inscription read , `` During the time he served as U.S. president , Mr. Nixon opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations and made historic contributions . ''
Luo 's inscription expressed his deep condolences and sent his best regards to Nixon 's family and relatives .
Nixon died of a major stroke on the evening of April 22 at the Cornell Medical Center in New York at the age of 81 .
The Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mr. Qian Qichen and other officials went to the U.S. Embassy here this morning to express their condolences on the death of former U.S. President Mr. Richard M. Nixon .
Several Chinese leaders including Mr. Jiang Zemin , Mr. Li Peng , Mr. Zhu Rongji and Mr. Qian Qichen sent condolence messages to mourn Mr. Nixon 's death the day after the former president died .
The Chinese leaders praised Mr. Nixon for his strategic farsightedness and political bravery when in his capacity as 37th U.S. President together with Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai he opened the era of diplomatic ties between China and the United States .
Mr. Nixon said in his speech that the two countries were once enemies and they still harboured great differences .
At 2108 on 22 April 1994 , Richard Nixon , a contemporary U.S. statesman with deep strategic insight and a former U.S. President , passed away at New York Hospital -- Cornell Medical Center , after suffering a stroke .
Richard Nixon was born on 9 January 1913 in Yorba Linda , a small town near Los Angeles , California .
From 1946 onward , Nixon held the office of representative and senator , ran for governor , and was twice nominated Republican presidential candidate .
For eight years , from 1952 to 1960 , Nixon held the post of vice president under Eisenhower .
During his six-year presidency , Nixon fully displayed his deep insight as an international strategist and his courage and resourcefulness as a statesman .
Nixon had great respect for Mao Zedong .
Addressing a banquet during his first visit to China , he said : `` Chairman Mao once wrote : `So many deeds brook no delay !
After that , Nixon visited China many times .
Within a decade , it will make them rude -LSB- wu li 2477 4409 -RSB- -LSB- Nixon 's original wording is `` irrelevant '' -RSB- .
The `` Watergate Affair `` occurred in the United States when Nixon was playing an influential role in the international arena .
This was no doubt a formidable blow to Nixon .
Less than a month before his death , he braved severe cold to visit Moscow .
Nixon 's death has shocked the world .
Four living former U.S. presidents were highly appreciative of Nixon 's political life .
Gerald Ford said : `` Nixon was , if not the best , at least one of the best presidents in terms of foreign policy . ''
Jimmy Carter said : `` His historic visits to China and the Soviet Union paved the way for Deng Xiaoping 's visit in person to the United States ; and for the normalization of Sino-U.S. -USSR relations as well . ''
Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger had the following comments : Nixon was in fact an idealist , but at the same time he was also a realist .
From 27 April , Nixon will forever rest at his place of birth , Yorba Linda .
With Support From China , Create U.S. - Soviet Equilibrium -- Nixon , Mao Zedong Cooperate in Breaking Bipolar World
Richard Nixon 's strategic insight and practice have rarely been seen in the contemporary world , but Nixon was also the only person who was forced to step down from power for violating the law of his own country , although he broke fresh ground in U.S. diplomatic strategy .
Nixon 's impact on international politics remains indelible , not because he was involved in the `` Watergate incident , '' but because he opened the door to Sino - U.S
In other words , if there had only been Nixon 's wish and if the Chinese leaders had not had the same intention , there would not have been `` a week which changed the world '' -LRB- Nixon 's own words -RRB- .
This was the historical significance of Nixon 's visit to China .
On the grand stage of history , Nixon and Mao Zedong played a leading role together ; Kissinger and Zhou Enlai also played an important role .
Nixon mounted the political stage very early .
In 1968 , Nixon was elected as the 37th president of the United States .
When Nixon became the occupant of the White House , he faced a situation in which crises and opportunities existed side by side .
The United States ' involvement in the Vietnam war , like its involvement in the Korean War , was aimed at checking a nonexistent `` Chinese threat , '' but the United States did not win either of these wars .
China did not yield to the United States , nor did it yield to the Soviet Union .
In 1969 , shortly after Nixon took office , he met with De Gaulle .
The French president told Nixon : `` You had better recognize China as soon as possible , and you should not recognize China after it becomes strong . ''
Nixon was deeply impressed by this advice .
After studying the new trend , Nixon found that Soviet threats against China showed that the Soviet Union had become more aggressive .
In his memoirs , Kissinger mentioned Nixon 's strategic change and said : This was a `` revolutionary theory '' and an `` important event in the foreign policy of the United States , '' because `` a President of the United States had announced that the survival of a major communist country was of strategic significance for us . ''
The above-mentioned factors show that Nixon had changed U.S. China policy due to many considerations , but the most important consideration was the long-term national interests of the United States .
The `` Cultural Revolution `` was a major mistake committed by Mao Zedong in his later years , but this does not mean that Mao did not make any major contributions to the country in his later years .
His meeting with Nixon was one of the most important and impressive diplomatic events of this century .
The meeting marked the climax of Nixon 's epoch-making visit to China , and made the seven-day visit `` a week that changed the world . ''
Nixon also has no interest .
`` If he wants to visit Beijing , you may bring a message to him and tell him that he can come quietly in private .
Three months later , Kissinger made his secret visit to Beijing .
The United States tried to hinder and block New China for a long time during the Cold War and this did not benefit it in the slightest .
It was President Nixon who changed U.S. policy toward China and this is a lesson to remember .
Vice Minister of State Economic and Trade Commission Yu Xiaosong Expresses Optimism About Extension of MFN Status
To extricate itself from the embarrassment caused by the linkage , the Clinton administration , following Secretary of State Christopher 's visit to China in March this year , recently sent Michael Armacost to Beijing as the President 's special envoy , to seek a way out with Chinese cooperation .
The late political leaders of the two countries , Mao Zedong and Nixon , could facilitate Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties precisely because they proceeded from a strategic height , surpassing their ideological differences , seeking common ground while reserving differences , and reaching cooperation based on mutual benefit .
No sooner did the Japanese Diet pass the `` UN Peacekeeping Activities and Cooperation Law `` in April 1992 than Japan sent self-defense troops to take part in the UN peacekeeping effort in Cambodia .

More recently , Xiaoze Yilang -LSB- 1420 3419 0001 6745 -RSB- , an official of the New Life Party , put forward a `` conventional nation `` theory in his book A Plan for Transforming Japan While he did not use terms like `` political power , '' he came up with a number of new suggestions such as amending the constitution , changing the nature and strategy of the self-defense forces , participating in UN peace-keeping activities , pushing for a permanent seat on the Security Council , and building a new world order side by side with the United States and Europe .
-LRB- United States Information Agency , 9 June 1993 -RRB- In July 1993 , Clinton called for a `` new Pacific community '' during his visit to Japan and South Korea and proposed upgrading the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation -LSB- APEC -RSB- ministerial conference scheduled to be held in Seattle under the auspices of the United States to an informal conference attended by heads of government .
World leaders praised Richard Nixon at the weekend for his bold foreign policy moves , with some of America 's Cold War enemies most warm in their praise , AP and Reuters report .
China 's Communist leaders hailed Nixon as a man of 'strategic foresight and political courage ' in messages of condolences .
Mr Nixon also was warmly remembered in Russia .
Mr Yeltsin had refused to meet Mr Nixon during his 10-day trip to Russia last month because the former president had met with some of Yeltsin 's political opponents .
But Mr Nixon is credited with establishing the policy of detente toward the Soviet Union during his presidency and , in recent years , with pushing for US aid for Russia .
Even India , whose relations with the US reached an all-time low during Mr Nixon 's administration , commended the former president for taking bold steps in international affairs .
'Although President Nixon 's term was marked by a certain controversy , he was well known in international affairs as having been courageous enough to take bold steps such as normalisation of relations with China and steps towards East-West detente , ' Foreign Ministry spokesman Shiv Shankar Mukherjee said .
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who was ambassador to the US during Mr Nixon 's presidency , praised his support of Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War 'in the face of the opposition of most of the world ' .
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali , secretary-general of the United Nations , extending his condolences , called Mr Nixon 's impact in international affairs 'especially significant . '
Sir Edward Heath , who was Britain 's prime minister in 1970-74 , hailed Mr Nixon 's diplomatic skills .
On the other hand , the United States and China no longer operate in close tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a decade ago .
In the first place , the United States and China did not even have any diplomats living and working in the heartland of each other 's territory .
The tension eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and , ultimately , with Reagan 's own election-year visit to China in 1984 .
Now , Deng is 84 , and some American officials and scholars have suggested privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership , in much the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976 .
Next month , he said , a team of Polish emissaries will visit 10 U.S. cities to learn the rudiments of running a local government .
When President Richard M. Nixon visited China , for example , U.S. towns rushed to find partners in that country , said Dick Oakland , director of member services for Sister Cities International .
In 1979 , during the American hostage crisis , Los Angeles unilaterally suspended its sister city relationship with Tehran , and did not even bother to inform its sister city 's government .
We met with the Chamber of Commerce , did some Rotary -LRB- clubs -RRB- , had a lot of private dinners and receptions . ''
But Khrushchev 's 1959 visit to China -- together with an only slightly less tense trip in 1958 -- can be said to mark the start of the Moscow - Beijing split that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping hope to heal this week in the first Sino- Soviet summit since 1959 .
`` On his two visits to Peking , in 1958 and 1959 , he and Mao did not get along .
I think he did so because of some sick fantasy .
There was some grumbling , but Orange County is by Western standards small -- 785 square miles -- and most people in Los Angeles did not seem to notice their southern neighbors ' secession .
Although the klan was certainly white supremacist and restricted its membership to Protestants , it did not base its appeal on overt racism .
Liberal Republicans often did better than conservative ones .
Nixon , who came from nearby Whittier , had impeccable conservative credentials , but his actions threw the John Birch Society , which was named after an early victim of Red China , into a tizzy .
Nixon Denounced
Schmitz denounced Nixon 's trip to China as a betrayal and suggested that he stay there .
Nixon returned the favor by finding a successful opponent for Schmitz 's congressional seat .
Nor did Reagan 's moderating of his domesticand foreign policy agenda , including his opening to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , in any way mitigate his popularity here .

Almost three years after its premiere , Music Center Opera finally will present `` Nixon in China `` -- the opera it agreed to co-produce in 1986 .
Post-Tian An Men Square , the ending of `` Nixon in China `` -- the staging , at least -- has been revised .
In another departure from the original production , `` Nixon `` has gained the hotly debated blessings of supertitles .
As in Houston and elsewhere , `` Nixon `` will be amplified and is , of course , in English .
As Nixon in China opened diplomatic doors , so `` Nixon in China `` has been opening opera doors -- literally and metaphorically -- around the world .
With its expressive , amplified , post-minimalist music , its use of iconic figures from the mythology of the media culture , its dramaturgic freshness , `` Nixon in China `` is representative of a burgeoning and peculiarly American school of opera , one that sells readily to a public here and in Europe .
In the use of such figures , `` Nixon in China `` is not unique -- Anthony Davis ' `` X : The Life and Times of Malcolm X `` and Philip Glass ' `` Satyagraha `` are important and influential predecessors -- though it is groundbreaking in using subjects who are still living .
Houston Grand Opera protected itself , its co-commissioning companies and the `` Nixon `` creators , with an `` errors and omissions '' insurance policy in case material in the opera was challenged as defamatory or not in the public domain .
-LRB- In case you were wondering , Nixon himself has not seen the opera .
Post-modern theater is much more intent on involving audiences than alienating them , and contemporary figures such as Nixon , Malcolm X and Gandhi have been subjects of contemporary American operas in part because of the immediacy of the feelings they arouse .
Stories like Nixon 's are larger than life , but there is a verisimilitude , a documentary quality to them . ''
The `` Nixon `` gang of three is now hard at work on `` The Death of Klinghoffer , '' dealing with the tragic events of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking , which may prove even more polarizing and controversial .
It 's a little more articulated structurally '' than `` Nixon , '' he says , and less like a verismo opera .
-LRB- The `` Nixon `` recording was also contracted before the opera premiered , as was the telecast -- rare indeed for any contemporary opera , let alone a neophyte effort . -RRB-
Is there then an in-joke hidden in Mao 's pensive lines in the `` Nixon `` finale ?
As Sellars grapples yet again with `` Nixon , '' there are already other takes on the opera .
There , in defiance of librettist Goodman 's insistence that the opera is heroic , Nixon and Mao were given putty noses in a garish and heavy-handed satire .
`` I think lots of things are conspiring so that now companies are competing for new operas , '' says Sellars , who in characteristic fashion chortles openly over the success of `` Nixon . ''
Nixon also spoke with Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin about the `` tragedy '' of the military crackdown on student-led dissent , the American informant said .
Nixon told Deng that he had observed relations closely for 17 years and that `` there has never been a more difficult crisis than at the present time . ''
He did not identify those leaders .
Deng and Nixon , who was on the fourth day of a private visit , agreed that ideological differences should be overcome and relations improved on the basis of common strategic interests .
`` I 'm very much in favor of your view regarding state-to- state relations , '' Deng said to Nixon as they met at the Great Hall of the People .
Nixon has urged the governments to bury their differences over the crushing of dissent and mend their frayed relations .
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping , in a meeting Tuesday with former President Richard M. Nixon , accused the United States of deep involvement in last spring 's pro-democracy protest in Beijing , the official New China News Agency reported .
`` Frankly speaking , the United States was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago , '' Deng reportedly told Nixon in a 95-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People .
`` This time the concerns developed not from those who are foes of China but from those who are friends of China , '' Nixon said .
Nixon met later in the day with Jiang Zemin , who in late June replaced Zhao Ziyang as general secretary of the Communist Party .
The news agency said Jiang `` reassured Nixon that the opened door of China will not be closed again . ''
Former President Richard M. Nixon , speaking at a farewell banquet Wednesday evening , told his Chinese hosts that the June crackdown on pro-democracy protests `` will inevitably color American opinion and behavior toward China . ''
`` The fact is that many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Nixon said in a toast to Chinese President Yang Shangkun , one of the key people responsible for ordering troops into Beijing to crush the protests .
Nixon acknowledged that `` many Chinese leaders deeply believe that the American reaction represents an intrusion in their internal affairs , '' adding : `` The age-old clash of ideas that now divides our nations is clear : the assertion of sovereignty of the state versus the universal rights of man . ''
Nixon , a copy of whose speech was made available to the foreign press , said that U.S. sanctions against China and criticism of the crackdown have caused Chinese leaders to `` recall bygone days when their nation was bullied and exploited by outside powers . ''
Yang , in a toast to Nixon , declared that `` Sino-U.S .
`` They have forgotten , '' he said , `` the lesson of history : Only after waging an extremely arduous struggle for over a century did the Chinese people finally win their basic rights -- the independence of the state and the dignity of the nation . ''
An American traveling with Nixon , who briefed reporters on the condition that he not be identified by name , said that Nixon has privately offered Chinese leaders several ideas on measures China might take to help restore friendlier ties .
Specifically , he said , Nixon suggested that police stationed outside the U.S. Embassy stop carrying semiautomatic rifles .
On Wednesday morning , Nixon chatted with pedestrians along a shopping street , then visited the U.S. Embassy for a noon speech to the staff .
It was the spring of 1934 , and young Dick Nixon was earnestly warning a fellow graduate at Whittier College against accepting a fellowship at a Chinese university .
Last week , more than a half century later , there was Richard Nixon himself back in China , taking the political and public-relations risk of talking to a Communist leadership that so recently and so brutally crushed popular demonstrations for democracy .
The week that began with an actor re-creating on ABC television the hunched shoulders and rambling dialogue of that tragic twilight of the Nixon White House , the death throes of Watergate , ended with news photos of a real-life , smiling Nixon working a crowd in downtown Beijing .
Nixon the grand strategist , the blunt but skillful diplomat , just like old times .
China has always been a strange , twisting thread in Richard Nixon 's remarkable life .
But on occasion when speakers would visit the campus to talk about the momentous current events of the era -- China 's civil strife and Japanese aggression , the crucible from which Communist China would eventually emerge -- Nixon paid attention .
`` Nixon listened . ''
Later , China would exert a fateful , often hidden force in Nixon 's political rise .
The China lobby of Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek was instrumental in Nixon 's election to the Senate in 1950 .
For those who knew the history and his secret ambition , the startling visit to the Chinese Communists and seeming betrayal of his old Nationalist patrons came as no real surprise .
Instinctively , temperamentally , Nixon vastly preferred the symmetry , the neatness and conclusiveness , of secret diplomacy .
There was a sense about the Nixon who came to the White House in 1969 that he was somehow in the wrong office , that he had so studied and relished foreign policy that he was preparing all those years not to be President , but rather a great secretary of state , a foreign minister absorbed in his beloved initiatives with none of the fears and flailings of a political existence he half despised .
Now , as Nixon makes his reappearance as envoy extraordinary , the world is less than ever amenable to his quiet , controlling talks .

Well , they might meet in the final minutes , but why should I spoil your fun by specifying whether they do ; whether Seattle widower Tom Hanks and Baltimore pen- friend Meg Ryan actually fulfil their mooted Valentine 's Day tryst atop the Empire State Building ?
He first set the two hearts fluttering by pushing lonely Dad into a radio agony phone-in where he bared his soul to a listening world including , 3000 miles away in a car , the captivated Ryan .
Sundered by a continent , each spends the film dithering with his or her respective dates or mates : Hanks with a hyena-laughed former flame he has re-ignited , Ryan with her stuffy fiance Walter -LRB- Bill Pullman -RRB- .
And yes , soon Ryan is hankering after Hanks : a fact we recognise from her constant re-viewings of An Affair To Remember on TV , used by Ephron as a flag-of-distress romantic leitmotif , and from her sobbings over Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr as they stumble star-crossed towards the world 's tallest building .
Laughing All the Way to the Awards : Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal gave `` When Harry Met Sally .
Ryan was named 1989 's funniest film actress and Crystal funniest film actor for their lead roles in the movie .

The summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for the US movie industry , which releases its most popular films now or at Christmas , when people tend to have more leisure .

`` What people do n't know as much about is La Nina , which imposes the opposite condition .
Local experts suggest maybe a new name is needed .
He speculated that part of the extreme conditions , not just here but nationally , is caused by El Nino and the greenhouse effect .
`` El Nino is the shifting of temperatures on the surface of the sea , '' Hibbert said .
Normally , El Nino affects Southern California with much wetter weather .

Jack Roosevelt Robinson turned it around in an adventure that aroused the spirit of his race and opened the eyes of whites throughout the nation .
Scout Wid Matthews watched Robinson play with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League .
`` Jackie Robinson can protect the strike zone better than any other young ballplayer I 've ever seen , '' Matthews reported .
That helped to sell Rickey , who met with Robinson in Brooklyn on Aug. 28 , 1945 .
Robinson exclaimed .
For the fiery , competitive Robinson , it would be his toughest battle .
The Duke , later to be Jackie 's teammate with the Dodgers , recalled with a chuckle of admiration Robinson 's exploits at Pasadena JC .
On May 8 , 1938 , Robinson performed two feats usually reserved for pulp fiction .
Besides the long jump at Pasadena City College , Robinson ran a 9.7 100 , a 21.5 220 , a 48.5 440 ; he pole-vaulted 13 feet , had a 23.7 mark for the 220 low hurdles and ran on the 440 relay team .
The first time he attempted golf , 1,000 people watched Robinson break 90 at Pasadena 's Brookside Park .
And Robinson was a quick and talented boxer .
Robinson was college football 's leading ground gainer in 1939 , averaging 11.4 yards -a-carry and returning punts for a 16.4-yard average .
The late Cotton Warburton , one of USC 's famed backs of yesteryear , called Robinson the most exciting back he ever saw .
`` Coach Jones -LRB- USC Coach Howard Jones -RRB- would put his best defensive man on Robinson telling the defender to tackle him whether he had the ball or not . ''
Robinson won the 1940 NCAA long jump with a leap of 24 feet 10 1/4 inches indoors at the University of Minnesota field house .
With the outbreak of World War II , Robinson entered officer candidate school at Ft .
After Robinson was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant , he became morale officer of a Negro truck battalion .
Robinson , how would you like your wife sitting next to a -LRB- black -RRB- ? ''
The battalion commander supported Robinson .
Robinson quit the Ft .
Robinson wanted no part of a team that would bow to racial prejudice .
Robinson was acquitted , but it was a needless and humiliating incident .
Robinson batted .345 for Kansas City in 1945 .
Robinson banged out four hits in five trips to the plate with three singles and a home run .
He stole second twice and scored four runs -- two of which came when the pitcher balked after becoming unnerved by Robinson 's dashes down the third base line .
Campanis , who three years ago was forced to resign as Dodger vice president /general manager as a result of his remarks about blacks , recalled vividly Robinson 's skills .
`` Robinson was a big man , '' Campanis continued .
Robinson took an incredible amount of verbal abuse during the year with Montreal , and there was always the beanball .
`` You never saw anything like it , '' said Dixie Howell , the catcher who was Robinson 's teammate at Montreal and later in Brooklyn .
Robinson was promoted to Brooklyn for the 1947 season .
Jackie Robinson became a star with hatred ringing in his ears .
The St. Louis Cardinals threatened to strike if Robinson played .
Alabama -born manager Ben Chapman and his Phillies were all over Robinson .
It might have been the turning point in the season as the Dodgers rallied around Robinson .
During that first year -- 1947 -- Robinson won the rookie of the year award , as the Dodgers took the National League pennant .
Robinson garnered his first of two stolen base titles with 29 thefts .
Robinson 's top year was 1949 , when he won the National League 's most valuable player award .
Thereafter , Robinson split his time between third base and the outfield .
Billy Cox , with the hands of a pickpocket , could be compared with Brooks Robinson as a defensive third baseman .
But Robinson was the catalyst .
Before the 1949 campaign , Rickey and Robinson had another meeting .
Robinson joined Ty Cobb and Pepper Martin as the most exciting and competitive players to perform between the white lines .
Robinson even amazed his teammates with his daring .
At bat Jackie overcame `` football shoulders , '' once pointed out by Bob Feller , who claimed Robinson could n't get around on the fast ball .
Robinson played only one game -- in 1953 -- at shortstop in his major league career .
And it was Robinson who almost single-handedly got it for them .
Then Robinson turned and in his familiar pigeon-toed gait moved toward the dugout .
Robinson was traded to the hated Giants for Dick Littlefield and $ 35,000 on Dec. 13 , 1956 .
Robinson was beset with personal problems .
When he had the addiction beaten , the young Robinson was killed in an auto accident .
Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner , who is now a broadcaster for the New York Mets , emphasized , `` Robinson was the only player I ever saw who could completely turn a game around by himself .
Although Willie Mays of the Giants and Robinson were fierce rivals , they were friends off the field .
`` Jones hit Jackie with a pitch , then threw the ball into right field when he tried to pick Robinson off first .
Much of the bad feeling between Robinson and Durocher stemmed from a play at first base when Jackie barrelled over Giant second baseman Davey Williams .
But like the real-life black baseball slugger Josh Gibson , who may have been the model for the role , he is too old for the game by the time Robinson integrated the league in 1947 .
The set , by Ocie Robinson , is a wonderfully realistic depiction of a poor brick house , in front of which the ever-present bat and the ball suspended by a string speak volumes about where Maxson 's heart still remains .
Sets by Ocie Robinson .
Summers , an Oklahoma native who hung up his glove in 1954 , is one of an estimated 140 survivors of the Negro Leagues , the sole professional baseball forum for blacks in the United States before Branch Rickey , general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers , began the integration of the major leagues by signing Jackie Robinson in 1945 .
He certainly joins Jack Johnson , Jackie Robinson , Kenny Washington , Frank Robinson , Bill Russell .
He scouted Jackie Robinson for the part .
The executive explained he planned to break the color line and wanted Jackie to be his man .
The Robinsons lived on Pepper Street in Pasadena , where Jackie became am athletic legend .
On the mound were fireballing Don Newcombe , Ralph Branca , Preacher Roe and Carl Erskine , whose overhand curve was the best since Tommy Bridges ' .
Mays recalled an incident in Ebbets Field when he crashed into the wall after catching a line drive .
He ends up making his way in the world as best he can , marrying young , fathering a child , stealing -- and doing 15 years in prison for one of those robberies .
The roles of the sons prove most tentative here ; it 's as if the actors , like the sons themselves , have not quite settled on the best way to relate to this troublesome and troubling father .
Damon Bryant provides backbone to the story as Maxson 's best friend Jim Bono , who is looking to Maxson -- of all people -- for clues as to how to get through his own life as best he can .
During three years with the Burt varsity , Dryden played left guard on offense , then stayed along the line of scrimmage and played left guard on defense .
Had the times not been so tough , Dryden would have followed the rail line to Nashville and attended Tennessee State or Fisk .
`` Here we were , three top players on the best team in the NFL and none of us was making six figures .
He owns a temporary-employment services business , which means he has an easier time attending Malcolm 's games than Dryden had breaking free for his .
Dryden recalled walking through the parking lot after the Warren G. Harding Panthers of Warren had gone across the nearby Pennsylvania line and beaten a team from Sharon .
`` Lonnie was one of those big , strong ballplayers who hit powerful line drives , '' said Chico Renfroe , an Atlanta -based sportswriter .

Hanna-Rnate Laurien , president of the Berlin City 's parliament , made these remarks at a reception hosted by her in honor of Qiao Shi , who is here on an eight-day official goodwill visit to Germany .
She said she was very pleased that Qiao 's visit is paid following the China visits respectively by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last year and mayor of Berlin City Eberhatd Diepgen in 1988 .
With the German Federal Government and parliament to be moved to Berlin before the end of this century , the city will play more important roles in the country 's politics , economy and cultural life , he said .
`` We are particularly pleased to note that Berlin and China have shared very close relationship , '' he added .
THE Berlin city government gave its approval yesterday to the creation of Germany 's sixth or seventh largest bank by the merger of Berliner Bank , in which the city holds 56 per cent , and three other banks in the German capital .
Berliner Bank had long urged the merger with Landesbank Berlin and Berliner Pfandbrief - Bank , but the city , anxious to protect its stake in Berliner Bank , delayed the move .
Mr Norbert Meisner , Berlin 's economics secretary , said earlier that the merger would create a bank large enough to provide the increased investment needs in Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg state .
It would help reduce the burden on the city budget when Bonn is cutting its aid to Berlin .
Berliner Bank has benefited from expansion into east Berlin and Brandenburg since 1990 and is the only sizeable German bank to have kept its headquarters in the city .
The Berlin market reflects some of the uncertainties .
Rentals fell by 29 per cent in Munich and 24 per cent in Berlin while the volume of space let fell by a dismal 49 per cent .
A senior German official said here this evening that the visit to Germany by Qiao Shi , China 's National People 's Congress -LRB- NPC -RRB- Standing Committee , will strengthen Germany - China relationship .
BOTH Germany 's main political parties could end up the losers from an extraordinary legal decision to order a new state election in the city of Hamburg , the second smallest of the country 's 16 Lander .
The move , ordered by the constitutional court in the city because of an 'undemocratic ' selection process of candidates for Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's Christian Democratic Union , means a re-run of the poll held in 1991 .
An immediate opinion poll in the city showed the Social Democrats gaining just 40 per cent of the votes , compared with 48 per cent in 1991 .
The fact that the city party has been found guilty of undemocratic procedures in its own candidate selection seems likely to lose it further support .
The decision to site the future European Central Bank in Frankfurt will consolidate the city 's role as continental Europe 's leading financial centre .
It is the international flavour of the Frankfurt office market , with demand dictated to a large extent by foreign financial institutions , which has driven the fall in rentals in the city .

Now he had coaxed 11 of them , including one Englishman , to share his mid-life crisis and climb Kilimanjaro in style .
The incessant rain that never falls on Kilimanjaro in February had been replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes , according to the notes on the Ordnance Survey map .
The huge volcanic cone of Kilimanjaro remained invisible above and below us .
The sun rose behind the science-fiction peak of Mawenzi , Kilimanjaro 's little sister .
But then , to our great relief , it became clear why Kilimanjaro had to be climbed at night .
Yet we had 'done ' Kilimanjaro .
But Kilimanjaro 's succession of climates - from banana groves , through rain-forest , through a moss-zone that would delight any Japanese temple - gardener , through Afghanistan into Antarctica - was more striking and rapid than in the Himalaya .
This is because Kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up out of a 3 , 000ft plain .
We had come to Africa to climb Kilimanjaro , the dormant volcano located some 200 miles south of the Equator on the border between Kenya and Tanzania .
For Jim and me , dilettante backpackers and runners , the five-day , 52-mile Kilimanjaro ascent was a test of will and endurance .
Kilimanjaro is a Tanzanian national park , and each climbing party is required to have a guide who in turn provisions and cooks for the expedition .
Like most Kilimanjaro climbers , we elected to do the ascent Himalayan style , with porters carrying all but day packs .
Since the 1840s , when missionaries and geologists began trying to climb Kilimanjaro , mountaineering has become a major source of income and employment for the region .
The entrance to the park was crowded with Americans , Japanese , Australians and Europeans , some seeking climbing permits , others returning from successful -LRB- or abortive -RRB- attempts to reach Kilimanjaro 's summit .
The first leg of the expedition was a 5-mile climb through a rain forest that girdles Kilimanjaro at 6,000 to 9,500 feet .
-LRB- The Kilimanjaro massif rises out of a plain that is about 3,500 feet above sea level .
On our climb the next morning we broke through the upper reaches of the rain forest onto a grassy , rolling savanna , passed another hillock and caught our first glimpse of the 16 , 000-foot Mawensi , the younger , though far more weathered companion peak to Kibo , the main crater of Kilimanjaro .
Kilimanjaro climbers can go for the summit on a five - or six-day trip or spend a day or so wandering trails on the lower reaches .
02139 , telephone -LRB- 800 -RRB- 221-0814 , and Adventure Center , 5540-A College Ave. , Oakland 94618 , telephone -LRB- 800 -RRB- 227-8747 or -LRB- 415 -RRB- 654-1879 , offer Kilimanjaro as a seven-day adjunct to their African safaris .
-LRB- A number of Nairobi tour operators offer Kilimanjaro safaris through their Tanzanian affiliates -RRB- .
Getting to Kilimanjaro can be expensive and time-consuming .
British Air , KLM , Ethiopian and Pakistan Airlines fly into Kilimanjaro International Airport .
Still , there is only one flight a week between Kilimanjaro and Nairobi .
Imagine , you 're a network sportscaster , covering college basketball in February , when your boss calls and says , `` Next week , we 're sending you to Africa to cover an attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro .
Twelve mentally disabled Californians , ranging in age from 19 to 30 , went on the Kilimanjaro venture , accompanied by a coach for each and an independent film crew headed by Emmy Award-winning producer Mike Tollin .
Kilimanjaro is located about 150 miles south of Nairobi on the border between Kenya and Tanzania .
Only about 25 % of the people who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro make it to the top .
The mountain veiled itself again , and stayed hidden from us , bar the odd glimpse , for the next four days .
Of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate 'tourist ' route up the mountain that night , just two stumbled with us to this true summit .
The equatorial sun , grilling down on us with pure ultra-violet , had melted the top of the mountain into a great , barely climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand .
We reached the highest tourist refuge , Kibo Huts , at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby bunks for a brief doze .
We had avoided the normal , much-trodden Marangu route up the mountain and had taken the more beautiful Machame trail .
Although professional climbers sometimes scoff at the mountain as being `` technically unchallenging , '' the altitude and cold -- as many of our companions discovered -- proved otherwise .
Built by the British in the late 1940s , the Moshi Hotel bears its pre-independence name -- the Livingstone Hotel -- in large stucco letters on the cornice .
There is a danger of not getting one -- especially in August when the mountain is so crowded .
This portion of the mountain is almost perpetually covered with dense , low-lying clouds below which lichen- and creeper-shrouded trees and grasses have adapted to life with little sunlight .
-LRB- In World War I a troop of German soldiers , trapped behind relentlessly advancing British troops , surrendered at the cave after having hidden out on the mountain for eight months -RRB- .
The equatorial sun was out in full force when we finally reached the rock on the western rim that marks the highest point on the African continent .
I 'd always heard of the exhilaration of surveying the panorama after conquering this mountain .
A number of American adventure travel companies , including Mountain Travel Inc. , 1398-M Solano Ave .
Those traveling on their own can make arrangements to climb the mountain through the Marangu Hotel , P.O .
Nighttime temperatures on the mountain can fall to zero degrees Fahrenheit , and rain is common even in the dry season .
NBC probably will name at least one fairly soon , since it will televise Magic Johnson 's `` Midsummer Night 's Magic `` all-star game at the Forum on Aug. 11 .
Ratings game : Although the World Cup final got only a 2.2 national cable rating , which translates to about a 1 rating overall , the soccer match drew an L.A. rating of 7.6 on Channel 34 , the highest L.A. sports rating of the day .

The two -man crew comprised chief warrant officer Bobby Hall and his co-pilot chief warrant officer David Hilemon , who was killed .
The pilot , Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall , crossed the border at Panmunjom into South Korea .
In his ambiguous confession , Mr Hall admitted that his reconnaissance helicopter made an 'intrusion deep ' into North Korean airspace , adding 'this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable ' .
Mr Hall 's statement said his helicopter 'deviated ' from its planned flight route within South Korea , but gave no explanation why it strayed across the demilitarised zone into the North .
But some South Korean government analysts believe Mr Hall 's statement that it was on an 'observation reconnaissance ' mission could be interpreted as espionage if North Korea decides to press the affair .
Analysts were divided over whether the statement by Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall would speed his release or provide Pyongyang with new grounds to detain him in return for possible concessions from the US .
Mr Hall admitted that his OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter made an 'intrusion deep ' into North Korean airspace , adding 'this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable ' .
Mr Hall 's statement said that his helicopter 'deviated ' from its planned flight route within South Korea , but gave no explanation for why the helicopter strayed across the demilitarised zone .
But some South Korean government analysts believe that Mr Hall 's statement that the helicopter was on an 'observation reconnaissance ' mission could be interpreted as espionage if North Korea decided to press the affair .
Chief Warrant Officer Hall reported that after he brought the craft to the ground , he pulled his gravely wounded co-pilot , Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon , from the aircraft , according to a US government official .
Mr Hall told officials that Mr Hilemon died a short time later , the official said .
Mr Hall said he was well treated in captivity , the official said .
North Korea yesterday returned Mr Hall yesterday .
The US is 'pleased that we can now look to the future and implement the important project ' , said Mr Thomas Hubbard , deputy assistant secretary of state , who spent two 'difficult ' days in Pyongyang negotiating Mr Hall 's release .
The return of Mr Hall was the result of a diplomatic compromise .
However , North Korea appeared satisfied by a 'confession ' signed by Mr Hall , which described the 'illegal intrusion ' as a 'criminal action ' and asked for forgiveness by Pyongyang .
The official news agency quoted Hall as saying : 'I admit that this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable .
North Korea yesterday refused to hold a meeting requested by the US to discuss the return of a US pilot and the body of his co-pilot killed in the crash of their army helicopter in North Korea .
The announcement appeared to dash hopes that North Korea would try to resolve the incident quickly .
Mr James Laney , the US ambassador to Pyongyang , said in Atlanta he believed North Korea would release the crew quickly rather than risk endangering relations .
North Korean officials explained that their leadership was 'too busy with the investigation ' into the incident to hold talks on the pilot 's release , according to a spokesman for the US military in Seoul .
North Korea 's rejection of the US talks proposal could reflect deep divisions within the North Korean leadership on how to resolve the issue .
The North Korean military is believed to be opposed to Pyongyang 's recent rapprochement with the US , and may try to use the incident as justification for its stance that the US still represents a threat to the country .
A long delay in solving the issue of the helicopter crash will increase pressure in Washington for the US to take a tougher stance on aid to North Korea .
The two -man OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter crashed on Saturday , three miles north of the eastern end of the demilitarised zone that divides North from South Korea .
The North Koreans claim that they shot down the helicopter , but the US says that it may have had to make an emergency landing after straying across the demilitarised zone because of a navigational error .
One explanation for Pyongyang 's rejection of the proposed talks could be that the US wants to discuss the pilot 's release through the military armistice commission which supervises the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean war .
North Korea withdrew from the commission earlier this year in an attempt to press the US to sign a peace treaty formally ending the war , although it still maintains low-level contacts with US military officials at the border truce village of Panmunjom .
The resumption of commission meetings on the issue would represent a setback to North Korea 's diplomatic strategy .
North Korea appears to be using the presence of Mr Richardson as a conduit to resolve the incident .
Mr Richardson , a Democratic representative from New Mexico , was originally scheduled to hold talks on the nuclear programme accord before he was thrust into an unexpected role of trying to arrange the return of the pilot .
North Korea early today released a US airman whose helicopter went down over the communist state nearly two weeks ago .
His release appeared to defuse the fresh diplomatic row that flared up between Pyongyang and Washington only two months after they had finalised an accord on the North 's nuclear programme .
A Washington official said the US had expressed 'sincere regret ' for the helicopter 's violation of North Korean air space .
It agreed to hold contacts with the North in an 'appropriate forum ' to prevent similar incidents in the future .
But North Korea could well press for separate bilateral talks .
But any further delay in his release might have increased chances of the new Republican -controlled US Congress trying to block implementation of the US nuclear accord with North Korea .
The pilot 's apology may have provided a face-saving means for his release while allowing North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter .
The statement , if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe , did not offer much support for Pyongyang 's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate .
This could imply support for the US claim that the helicopter lost its way due to a navigational error .
North Korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the US sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean war and begin withdrawing its 37,000 troops from South Korea .
An ambiguous 'confession ' signed by a US army helicopter pilot captured by North Korea almost two weeks ago could further complicate efforts to secure his release .
If his return is delayed further , it is likely to increase prospects that the new Republican -controlled US Congress will try to block implementation of the recent US nuclear accord with North Korea .
'I only hope , and it is my desire , that the -LRB- North -RRB- Korean People 's Army will leniently forgive me for my illegal intrusion so that I may return to my home and be with my family again , ' he concluded .
The apology may provide a face-saving means for his release , while allowing North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter .
The statement , if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe , does not offer much support for Pyongyang 's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate .
This could imply support for the US claim that the helicopter lost its way after a navigational error .
Whether North Korea will try to use the issue to gain concessions from the US is still unclear as it negotiates with a senior US diplomat who has travelled to Pyongyang to gain the pilot 's release .
His release appeared to ensure that the recent US - North Korean nuclear agreement will proceed smoothly after Washington warned earlier that his continued detention could jeopardise the accord .
Under the nuclear accord , the US has promised to establish diplomatic ties with North Korea and guarantee international aid if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear programme .
The US expressed regret for the intrusion of the helicopter into North Korean airspace , which Washington said was an accident caused by a navigational error .
The US did not offer a formal apology as demanded by North Korea , which claimed the helicopter was on a spy mission .
North Korea claimed the US had agreed to further bilateral military contacts to prevent future incidents .
A senior US diplomat arrived in Pyongyang yesterday to seek the release of a US army pilot whose detention by North Korea threatens its recent nuclear agreement with Washington .
The visit by Mr Thomas Hubbard , a deputy assistant secretary of state , follows that of a US congressman who last week helped to arrange the return of the body of the pilot 's colleague , killed in the crash of their helicopter in North Korea .
Pyongyang claims the helicopter was on a spying mission and the North has demanded an acknowledgement of guilt and an apology from the US .
Last night North Korea said the pilot had confessed to intruding deep into its territory on a reconnaissance mission and had asked for forgiveness .
Washington said the helicopter flew into North Korea because of a navigational error .
Analysts believe other reasons may account for North Korea 's reluctance to release the pilot .
One possibility is that North Korea is trying to exploit the incident to gain new concessions from the US .
North Korea could argue that the helicopter incident underscores the need for such a peace treaty .
The US also agreed to guarantee international aid , including the supply of safer light-water reactors , if North Korea dismantled its current nuclear programme , which is suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
However , such a diplomatic strategy carries risks for North Korea since US congressional critics of the nuclear agreement may use the continued detention of the pilot as a reason to block the deal .
US critics of the accord believe that it offers too many concessions to North Korea .
Senator Bob Dole , who is soon to become US Senate majority leader , was quoted yesterday as calling the agreement 'a lousy deal ' and adding , 'you ca n't trust the North Koreans ' .
Even so , the delay may also reflect deep divisions between North Korea leaders over the nuclear agreement .
Mr Thomas Hubbard , a deputy assistant secretary of state , was part of the US team that reached the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation with North Korea in October .
He was sent on his new mission after North Korean diplomats at the UN had suggested that this would 'facilitate a resolution ' of the problem .
But broadcasts and statements from Pyongyang over the last 48 hours have alleged that the helicopter was on a spying mission and have demanded that the US admit as much .
US officials have maintained that it strayed into North Korea while on routine training because of a navigational error .
Even so , the US has apologised for the violation of the North 's air space .
Congressman Bill Richardson , the New Mexico Democrat who brought home the body of the other US pilot killed in the incident , said the new mission could strengthen the hand of the North Korean foreign ministry , adding that it was more eager for a resolution than was the North 's military command .
Mr Lee Hamilton , outgoing chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee , warned yesterday that Congress might delay a scheduled US oil shipment to Pyongyang so as to force the release of the pilot .
The US is to provide 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil , valued at about Dollars 4.7m -LRB- Pounds 3m -RRB- , to North Korea by January 21 as part of the October accord .
However , the US is anxious not to jeopardise the hard-won agreement which appeared to remove the immediate threat of the North acquiring an offensive nuclear capability .

'Counterviolence and deportations are not the answer we need to Israel 's legitimate security needs , ' General Powell told a Jewish audience at Yeshiva University in New York .
Gen Powell said the military had received 'good guidance ' from Mr Clinton and Mr Les Aspin , the new secretary of defence , with both of whom he had 'a fine relationship ' .
During an interview on ABC-TV 's `` This Week With David Brinkley , '' Powell was asked whether he considers the military system a `` meritocracy '' and whether it is an equal-opportunity employer .
Powell replied : `` More so than any other form of endeavor in our society .
Although members of both parties warmly pledged to work cooperatively with Cheney and Powell in the battles ahead , several Democrats served notice that they would press for deep cuts in the Administration 's proposals for increased spending on strategic weapons programs .
Powell likewise contended that this was no time for the nation to let down its guard .
Powell testified that ending production of the radar-evading B-2 would cause the chiefs of the military services to `` make a very careful reassessment '' of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- being negotiated by the United States and the Soviet Union .
When Aspin asked if Congress had to fund all 132 planned B-2s for the chiefs to continue endorsing START , Powell said he would have to check that .
`` All right , sir , '' Powell said .
Aspin also asked Powell what the military chiefs would do on START if Congress killed the truck -borne Midgetman strategic missile but retained the rail-mobile MX .
Although the Administration has requested funds for both long-range weapons in its fiscal 1991 budget , Powell said the chiefs probably could live with only the MX .
Addressing Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , Aspin asserted that `` change is outracing both our government 's arms control proposals and the defense budget you have put before us .
If his appointment is confirmed by the Senate , Powell will become Bush 's top adviser on military affairs and the nation 's senior military officer in a position that was greatly expanded in scope by a 1986 defense reorganization bill .
Powell would also be a principal adviser to the defense secretary and the National Security Council .
Bush is expected to announce his choice of Powell , who served as former President Ronald Reagan 's sixth national security adviser , this afternoon .
Powell would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. , the outgoing chairman .
Those who know Powell said that the President would find in him a consensus-seeking adviser sensitive to the vagaries of domestic and diplomatic politics .
Powell is currently commander in chief of Forces Command , which is responsible for the readiness of military units stationed in the United States .
Pentagon sources said that Powell appeared to be Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 's strong preference for the senior military post .
Powell met with Cheney at the Pentagon on Tuesday to discuss the job , sources said .
Powell won praise from lawmakers for helping to restore order to the White House National Security Council in the wake of disclosures that an NSC operation sold arms to Iran and diverted the profits to the rebels in Nicaragua .
At the time of the Iran-Contra scandal , Powell had been the military aide to then- Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger .
In that capacity , Powell administered the transfer of anti- tank missiles from Army stocks to Iran .
But Powell escaped criticism for his role in the affair and later in his capacity as national security adviser , even after many experts recommended that military officers should be barred from holding the sensitive White House position .
The Senate is expected to confirm Powell , whose name has been widely circulated as Crowe 's successor , without controversy .
`` Powell 's strength would fit right into the Crowe mold , in that he 's got a strategic sense as well as a good sense of military operation , '' one Capitol Hill aide said .
In choosing Powell for the post , Bush passed over several more senior candidates .
Powell was born in New York , the son of Jamaican immigrants , and is a graduate of City University of New York .
At the White House , Powell 's modest approach was highly praised -- and criticized .
`` Colin Powell has had a truly distinguished military career , and he 's a complete soldier , '' Bush said in announcing his selection of Powell , who served as former President Ronald Reagan 's sixth and last national security adviser .
Powell , 52 , a four-star general who is believed certain to win confirmation from the Senate , would replace Navy Adm. William Crowe in the country 's top military job on Oct. 1 .
Bush , Cheney and Powell also discussed the possibility of activating 200,000 reservists -- the maximum allowed by law unless the country is at war .
`` The real story is that , yes , I climbed well and I climbed hard , but that I climbed over the cliffs on the backs of those that went before , '' said Powell in a speech to the National Assn .
`` But now that we 're on top and looking over that cliff , there are still more rivers to cross , '' Powell said .
Powell 's tribute to black soldiers and sailors received spirited applause .
`` We must never send them forth to freedom 's defense unready or to the call of an uncertain trumpet , '' Powell said , referring to the prospect of flagging public and governmental support for future military commitments .
At the same time , Powell offered qualified praise for the Soviet Union and words of caution about prospects for immediate success in the efforts of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to reform his nation 's economic and political systems .
`` Except for in Central America , we even see Soviet foreign policy being more responsible , '' Powell said .
`` What we are seeing is a process that will take years and decades , not months , to unfold , '' Powell said .
However , Powell stopped short of echoing the controversial views of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , who predicted earlier this year that Gorbachev would fail in his reforms and be replaced by a more hard-line Soviet leader .
Powell would be the principal military adviser to Cheney and to President Bush , and a key voice in a presidential decision to commit forces to trouble spots abroad .
Powell , who became an Army officer 10 years after a presidential order ended segregation in the military , applauded the role that the armed forces have played in breaking down racial barriers .
The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell 's nomination to the full Senate .
If confirmed , Powell , who would be the youngest officer to head the Joint Chiefs , would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1 .
The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at which Powell told the panel that he has `` some level of confidence '' that reforms might succeed in the Soviet Union .
`` It 's very premature to start basing any of our plans and programs and actions '' on assumptions of Gorbachev 's success , said Powell .
told Powell : `` We certainly , I think , have to be prepared for backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union .
Echoing praise for Powell , who would be the first black to head the nation 's military services , Sen. Albert Gore Jr. -LRB- D - Tenn. -RRB-
called Powell 's appointment `` one of the finest appointments that our President has made . ''
Nunn said that Powell offered `` tremendous .
Powell now serves as commander of the U.S. Forces Command , which oversees all U.S. -based troops .
Responding to lawmaker 's concerns , Powell said that he would make the military 's role in the drug war one of his top priorities .
`` I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any reservations , '' said Powell .
-LRB- that -RRB- can be diverted from other missions , other training activities , to work with the Border Patrol and see if we can do a better job of sealing the border between the United States and Mexico , '' said Powell .
Powell told lawmakers that as the President 's principal military adviser in a time of shrinking budgets , he would `` rather have -LRB- a force -RRB- that is smaller , as long as it 's always ready to perform , as advertised , and when called upon . ''
Powell devised the plan while he was commander of the U.S. Forces Command , which is responsible for arming and training U.S. -based Army forces for the defense of the continental United States .
On Tuesday , in a meeting with Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz , the Saudi defense chief , Powell was understood to have sought more streamlined arrangements that would give the United States clear authority over the forces operating in support of U.S. military operations .
Speaking with reporters in Riyadh before the meeting , his first with Saudi officials since the crisis began , Powell said he expected to discuss `` the status of our buildup '' and to make `` a general review of all of our plans . ''
Gen. Maurice Schmitt , chief of staff of the French armed forces , met with top American commanders in Washington on Sunday in an effort to sort out some of the differences and will host Powell on a visit to Paris later this week .
`` You sit and go over all the details of our dispositions here , our defensive plans here , and obviously we examined every possible contingency with which we might be faced , '' Powell told a small pool of reporters .
In an interview with a French radio station , Powell said that he does not believe that war in the Persian Gulf is imminent , despite the recent announcement that another 200,000 American troops will be dispatched there .
`` We hope this show of resolve will convince Mr. Saddam Hussein that he should withdraw his forces , '' Powell said .
`` I have religiously conveyed the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in substance , tone and tint to the President throughout this entire period , '' Gen. Colin L. Powell declared in a bristling statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney both sought to counter earlier damaging testimony from former defense officials and others who said that sanctions against Iraq could work and that going to war would be a costly mistake .
Cheney and Powell both vehemently defended the strategy , arguing that international resolve to confront Hussein over his invasion and annexation of Kuwait may begin to waiver before he does .
Pressed by startled senators , who noted that most experts testifying before the committee have estimated that it would require between one year and 18 months for sanctions to take full effect , Cheney and Powell indicated that it may be unwise to wait even that long .
`` If Iraq does not have to take military pressure seriously , and is given 12 to 18 months grace , they can put their army into somewhat of a state of hibernation and stretch their sustaining capability , '' Powell said .
Laying out the rationale for Bush 's decision to beef up the U.S. force in the Persian Gulf , Powell told the senators that , to be credible , the offensive option must be backed by overwhelming force capable of attacking Iraq from the air , sea and ground .
In his statement , Powell derided as uninformed such officials as former Navy Secretary James H. Webb and independent military strategist Edward Luttwak , who questioned whether Powell had reflected concerns of his subordinates when taking with the President .
The emotional remarks underscored a widening rift between Powell and some former Reagan Administration defense chiefs , such as his predecessor as chairman of the Joint Chiefs , retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. , and Webb .
Powell made his comments just two days after the President met with him and the chiefs of staff of the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine Corps to hear their views on Operation Desert Shield .
The grumbling is fed by some in the military services who consider Powell more of a political general than one in tune with the troops .
The suggestion that Powell has neglected service concerns drew immediate denials from the Army and the Marine Corps .
Powell said Monday that he had met with all the service chiefs `` some 30 times '' in the last four months and that he has met individually with them daily .
`` The political leadership of this nation is enjoying solid , competent military advice from myself as well as from the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , '' Powell said .
Powell served during the Reagan Administration as White House national security adviser , and was widely considered a moderate in the Reagan White House .
But Monday , Powell showed a more hawkish side , defending the decision to field a force `` which seizes the initiative and forces the Iraqis to consider the consequences of a combined overwhelming air-land-sea campaign against a powerful coalition force . ''
Powell also made a pitch for reservists during his testimony , saying that their participation `` has been a significant factor in affording us flexibility and balance . ''
`` If you do n't believe me , believe Colin Powell ; and he has pretty good credentials in this field , outstanding credentials , '' Bush said , referring to the Army general who is the first black chief of staff .
Bush closely questioned Powell and other military officials about the details of their plan for a massive attack .
In a television broadcast to the nation , Mr Bush condemned the two days of violence that followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles policemen accused of beating Mr Rodney King , a black motorist .

Mr Baker will come in over the heads of Mr Sam Skinner , the White House chief of staff , and Mr Robert Teeter , titular campaign chairman and also an old friend .
Ms Jennone Walker , of the White House national security council , said that even if Russia could not assist in this particular operation it was administration 's general policy to offer Moscow 'a constructive role in European security , including a military role ' .
'The Yugoslav tragedy , ' she said , 'illustrates that military power still matters in Europe ' .
He appeared on morning television shows after a report in the New York Times had quoted 'friends and associates ' as saying he was unhappy with President Bill Clinton 's determination to admit homosexuals to the US military and with the extent of the defence budget cuts under consideration .
The general was also at pains to stress that the military at large was not distressed by the new policies .
He reiterated his 'concerns ' about admitting gays to the military , but said the president 's guidance on the issue was clear and he was not about to be 'insubordinate ' by frustrating it .
Nato chiefs have not excluded the use of air strikes in Bosnia but have warned about serious difficulties and risks involved in such a policy .
Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent , the committee chairman , said there was no indication that Nato military authorities would be asked to draw up plans for air strikes .
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday the US should not intervene in Bosnia without the support of its allies , despite the mounting pressure on the administration to take some kind of military action against the Bosnian Serbs .
The president repeated that he had not ruled out any option for action , except the direct intervention in Bosnia by US ground troops and that he had high hopes of reaching agreement on joint action with Britain , France and other European allies .
The New York Times also reported that 12 mid-level State Department officers handling the Balkan region had implored Secretary of State Warren Christopher to end 'western capitulation to Serbian aggression ' and use military force in Bosnia .
Mr Christopher has been reluctant to embrace military options and warned this week that air strikes might halt the UN relief operations in Bosnia .
This argument against military action has also been deployed by Britain and France , both of which have troops under the UN flag in Bosnia .
European Community foreign ministers will discuss the full range of military and diplomatic options to end the fighting in Bosnia at Hindsgavl Castle , near Copenhagen , today .
I 'm very proud of what we have done in the military over the years and I think , for the most part , it is a meritocracy .

He argued that Bush 's budget fails to reflect a dramatically diminished Soviet military threat and a massive upgrading of U.S. strategic weapons in the last decade .
At a hearing on President Bush 's defense budget , House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin -LRB- D - Wis. -RRB-
He noted that the chiefs had supported START talks in part because the B-2 could be used to take advantage of proposed rules for counting nuclear warheads under consideration in the negotiations .
At the House hearing , Aspin led a parade of Democrats and Republicans sharply challenging Cheney 's proposal to close 43 military bases -- including 10 in California -- and to consolidate or realign scores of others .
The committee chairman said Cheney should have done what his predecessor , Frank C. Carlucci , did in moving to close bases two years ago : propose having a bipartisan commission develop the list .
`` No , that 's high praise , Mr. Chairman , '' Cheney responded , laughing , `` high praise , indeed . ''
We already know that the black male is an endangered species in American society .
As the troubling statistics released at the recent NAACP convention point out , one in four black men is incarcerated or on probation or parole ; the murder rate for black males is 10 times that for white males ; black males are the only demographic group in the United States that can expect to live shorter lives in 1990 than they did in 1980 .
The black male is also an endangered species in Hollywood -LRB- `` Few Blacks Ever Reach the Studio Front Office , '' by David J. Fox , July 10 -RRB- .
Throughout film , television and video , the black male is shown to be , by my definition , non-threatening .
In most cases where the black has been cast as a primary dominant character in a threatening role , those shows have never survived television .
This does not happen with black shows .
They do n't get the number of times at bat and they also do n't get the better time slots -LRB- `` TV 's Shame : Lack of Dramas on Black Life , '' by Rick Du Brow , June 6 -RRB- .
Because blacks are the largest users of TV and heavy users of film and video programs , this paucity reinforces the lack of dominant or positive black male role models .
So what you have is young black kids going to movies and seeing no blacks in leadership roles .
The consequence is that blacks seem to not have any kind of direct guidance for male roles other than what they get from television , and in most cases the black male is either weak -- as a comedian -- or he is put in a situation of being a criminal , so he can be exterminated by the powerful authorities who happen to be white , or he is put in the position of a buddy , which means he is controlled and consequently non-threatening .
We need more people who see the black male as an integral part of society .
There are black mayors such as Tom Bradley .
I do n't think you can lay at Hollywood 's feet all of the problems and ills plaguing black society .
At the same time , the armed services would have as their leader an officer who started military life in 1958 as an infantryman and eagerly sought escape from a succession of political jobs to return to the command of `` mud soldiers . ''
He returned to that military post in April after serving as White House national security adviser from December , 1987 , to January , 1989 , when Bush named retired Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft to the White House position .
He would become the 12th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since the position was created in 1949 .
`` He also can look across military service lines and set broader defense priorities .
The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Air Force Gen. Robert T. Herres , was believed to be a contender for the position .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff normally serves a two-year term , although his tour of duty is determined by the President .
In choosing him for the post , Bush reached down the chain of command , bypassing such other officers as Army Gen. John Galvin , commander of NATO forces , and Air Force Gen. Robert Herres , the deputy chairman of the joint chiefs .
He is one of 14,425 military reservists and National Guardsmen in Orange County , and if Bush calls them to active duty in the Iraqi conflict , the impact on individuals
Employees called for involuntary duty in the reserves are entitled to reinstatement in their old job , or an equivalent one , at the same pay they held before their military stint .
Military officials in Washington said Orange County is home to 400 naval reservists , 1,025 Marine reservists and a substantial number of Army reservists based at Los Alamitos .
Ray Silvius , a spokesman for Fullerton -based Hughes , said the company grants military leaves to reservists and guarantees that their jobs will be protected until they return .
At Disneyland , 8,000 full-time employees are guaranteed a military leave of up to 30 days , spokesman Bob Roth said .
The Los Angeles Times , with 10,000 employees , 1,200 of them in Orange County , grants unpaid military leave to both full- and part-time workers for as long as service is required .
Employees are not required to apply their vacation time to military leave .
of Black Journalists .
The 52-year-old officer , now the commander of all U.S. -based American military forces , was the Ronald Reagan Administration 's sixth national security adviser .
He said that his appointment `` never would have been possible without the sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great nation in war for nearly 300 years previously . ''
`` If you look at the military , you will see the kind of opportunity for advancement that does n't exist in every part of our society , '' he said .
But he warned that changes in Soviet military capabilities , not budget restraints , should prompt the scale-back and called for continued modernization of long-range nuclear weapons .
Reflecting the rising skepticism , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn -LRB- D -Ga . -RRB-
In choosing the 31-year veteran to lead the nation 's 2 million troops , President Bush skipped over several more senior military officers .
`` This Administration has good people , but policy guidance has to start with the President , '' said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn -LRB- D -Ga. -RRB- , who charged that the Administration was caught without any plan of action .
Nunn and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren -LRB- D - Okla. -RRB- said the President had an obligation to issue detailed instructions to U.S. personnel in Panama telling them what to do in the event of a coup attempt .
If the rebels had been asked that question and if they had promised to install an elected government , Nunn said , the United States would then have had the `` moral basis '' on which to use military force to support the coup .
`` What people -- some people -- seem to have wanted me to do is to unleash the full military to go in and , quote , 'get Noriega , ' `` said Bush .
`` I suppose you could have gone to general quarters , but that 's not prudent and that 's not the way I plan to conduct the military or foreign affairs of this country . ''
They said that account is supported by a cable from U.S. military officials in Panama to Washington .
`` The F-117 's performance in Panama left it open to question , '' says Bill Arkin , a military critic at the environmental group Greenpeace .
The Vincennes incident also dramatized the problems of discriminating between civilian and military targets and between friendly and hostile forces .
With more than two dozen allied armies contemplating joint action against Iraq , and with many of the same weapons in use by both sides , the potential for catastrophic error on the battlefield is magnified , experts said .
The 19th-Century Prussian general and writer on military strategy , Karl von Clausewitz , called the snafu phenomenon `` friction '' -- the tendency in combat for everything possible to go awry .
Contemporary military strategist Edward N. Luttwak noted , `` The chief reason why armies experience problems -- sometimes severe problems , occasionally crippling problems -- at the outset of a war is that in designing their forces , they have underestimated or overlooked the effects of friction .
Recent military experiences , from the botched Iran hostage rescue mission in 1980 to the successful but less-than-perfect Panama invasion last December , ought to provide a sobering reminder to U.S. generals that war is inherently an unpredictable enterprise .
He warned that U.S. military leaders should be wary of underestimating Iraq 's capacity to withstand the pain of U.S. aerial bombardment .
More battles have been lost to blunder than to superior firepower or strategy , military analysts noted .
Military historian Harry G. Summers , a retired Army infantry colonel , cited the first battle of the Somme in World War I , when British Gen. Henry Rawlinson erred in believing that he could level German positions with a massive artillery barrage and not have to fight his way through them .
After leaving the army , he devoted much of his time to writing about the military .
It is a book that has cast an indelible stamp on all subsequent military thought .
In a new move to expand the military 's role in fighting drug traffic , the Marines on Friday agreed to join the Immigration and Naturalization Service in conducting training and surveillance operations along the southwest border of the United States .
The announcement of the agreement , which would put Marines on the front lines of the drug war for the first time , comes as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ponders a U.S. Army proposal to establish a special military task force at Ft .
The proposed new military organization , to be called `` Joint Task Force 6 , '' would help inspect cargo , conduct reconnaissance operations and ferry drug enforcement agents on raids along the border between the United States and Mexico , Pentagon officials said .
National Guard and Reserve forces have been used to watch border areas in the past but the INS-Marine Corps agreement marks the first assignment of full-time military personnel to such activity .
The joint efforts will be conducted primarily along the southern borders of Arizona and California , a Justice Department official said .
`` Some areas designated for joint training are heavily trafficked by drug smugglers , '' the memorandum said .
The military 's role is tightly circumscribed by the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act , which bars the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement .
Defense officials said that under both initiatives the military 's experience with night-vision equipment would bring a major new capability to the drug interdiction effort in the Southwest .
`` During night joint training operations , emphasis will be on ground reconnaissance , selection and manning of observation posts and the employment of night observation devices , '' the memorandum said .
Despite strong opposition to putting U.S. troops under foreign commanders , the Bush Administration has agreed to a high-level meeting of the military arm of the U.N. Security Council in a step that will broaden the U.N. umbrella for any military action against Iraq , Administration and diplomatic sources said Tuesday .
An Administration official confirmed that representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council are planning to meet soon at `` a three - star level , a lieutenant-general level , '' giving the long-moribund U.N. Military Staff Committee greater authority than it has had for the last four decades .
The move to upgrade the U.N. military arm is intended to help overcome the many problems of coordination that have arisen as multinational forces have gathered in the Persian Gulf .
The move also is aimed at accommodating the Soviet Union , which began pressing even before the gulf crisis to have the U.N. Military Staff Committee given new power .
Last month , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed that the United Nations set up a rapid-response force made up of military units from several countries to handle future emergencies like Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .
U.S. officials emphasized that the bolstering of the Military Staff Committee will not amount to setting up a formal U.N. military command .
A European diplomat suggested that the Military Staff Committee could provide a vehicle that would ease the concerns of countries such as France about having their troops in Saudi Arabia put under American direction .
`` It 's for sure that the Americans will play the most important role '' in the U.N. effort at military coordination , this diplomat said Tuesday .
The U.N. Military Staff Committee is made up of military officers from the United States , the Soviet Union , Britain , France and China .
Under the U.N. Charter , the committee was supposed to direct any military forces established by the Security Council .
But during the Cold War years , the Security Council was too divided to agree on any tasks for its military arm , which conducted only brief meetings involving low-level officers such as majors or colonels .
In 1987 , Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suggested that the Military Staff Committee be empowered to take on new tasks such as directing U.N. peacekeeping forces .
Since then , Soviet officials have kept pressing to give the U.N. military arm a larger role .
`` We must put life into the Military Staff Committee , '' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said last month .
Two weeks ago , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky proposed that the committee convene at the level of the military chiefs of staff .
`` The results of this effort to rely on the Military Staff Committee could be very important , not only for the Iraq crisis but for the next 20 years , '' the European diplomat said .
As a result , the United States has sought to conduct joint exercises with forces in adjoining positions .
After announcing the first U.S. - Saudi ground- force training operation last Thursday , American military officials abruptly canceled a trip for members of the press to follow-up exercises over the weekend , initially saying that the exercises had been postponed .
A military spokesman offered a new explanation Tuesday night , saying that the operation , which involved units firing 81-millimeter mortars , had gone so well that neither the United States nor Saudi Arabia saw any reason to repeat it .
There is no indication , however , that other units have yet begun similar joint training .
The exercise , which will simulate a tactic likely to be used in any actual U.S. military offensive , will be the first conducted in Saudi Arabia since Iraq 's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait .
At the same time , the exercise represents one of the most provocative gestures that the U.S. military has taken toward Iraqi troops dug into largely defensive positions just inside Kuwait .
The Pentagon 's acknowledgment of the pending military maneuver came as Bush Administration officials tried to quell growing concern on Capitol Hill that the United States is pressing to initiate hostilities soon against Iraq .
But Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams , in confirming reports of the planned amphibious landing exercise , denied that the Marine maneuvers are designed to provoke a reaction from Iraqi troops that could be used to justify a U.S. military response .
Sources at the Pentagon , however , acknowledged that this weekend 's activity , which follows two previous exercises staged on the beaches of Oman , is designed to underscore U.S. military readiness for operations against Iraqi troops .
`` It 's close enough to get their attention , that 's for sure , '' said one military officer familiar with the plans .
But he added that the planned expansion of the U.S. force in the gulf will require the Pentagon 's civilian leaders to extend the other military services ' reserve call-up authority .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff lashed out Monday at `` amateurs `` and former defense officials who have criticized the Bush Administration 's Persian Gulf policy or suggested that he is keeping deep-seated reservations about it in the Pentagon from reaching the President 's ears .
The two military leaders argued that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could ride out sanctions , and Cheney testified that `` it is far better for us to deal with him now . ''
Also Monday , Cheney raised to 188,000 the maximum number of military reservists who can be ordered to duty in Operation Desert Shield .
He said the Administration initially underestimated Iraq 's ability to substantially expand its food production and mobilize its military resources in the face of an embargo .
Sparring with Cheney , Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn -LRB- D -Ga. -RRB- said the Administration seems willing to dismiss the effect of sanctions too quickly .
But in private , a number of lawmakers and congressional aides are voicing concerns that the decision may represent little more than a tactic designed to quell criticism on Capitol Hill even as it helps to set the stage for eventual military action against Iraq .
Cheney described the Administration 's moves as a `` multi-track approach '' of applying economic pressure through sanctions , military pressure through continuing troop deployments and the `` exercise of a diplomatic alternative as well . ''
The meeting came after a flurry of complaints by some military officials that the services were being left out of the planning process .
While the service chiefs met with Bush in August at the outset of the Middle East crisis , the group did not meet again with him until last Saturday , weeks after he had made the decision to augment U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia .
Luttwak , an analyst with the Washington -based Center for Strategic and International Studies , told committee members that not all of the chiefs -- most notably Gen. Carl E. Vuono , the Army chief of staff -- had been fully consulted in advance of the decision to increase U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia .
Whether or not war is averted , the international community must deploy `` some kind of peacekeeping force `` in the Middle East to guarantee long-term stability and ensure that Iraq can never again mount a military threat , President Bush said Tuesday .
The President 's remarks in a press conference , and additional comments by Vice President Dan Quayle , reflect White House thinking on the role of U.S. forces and other military units in the Persian Gulf after the current crisis is resolved , either militarily or diplomatically .
Referring to sensitivity in the region to any suggestion that the massive U.S. military deployment would bring about a long-term presence of U.S. forces , Bush said any peacekeeping units would be international , `` because I think there 's a problem if U.S. forces remain on the ground in the gulf for some time . ''
`` He was very concerned about the loss of life , '' said a senior government official , `` but he also understands the role of the military and that they take those risks with pride . ''
Outwardly he has made almost a fetish of sticking to a business-as-usual schedule since he met secretly with aides Sunday night to approve specific plans for the massive military strike .
He was not only deeply involved in the military planning ; he also has been closely monitoring the results of the operation at every stage .
Yet for Bush and for every President , the decision to send military forces into action is a plunge into the unknown and the unknowable .
The President himself is well aware of these factors , said a senior aide , who described Bush as `` intense but unemotional '' Sunday as he questioned military officials about their plans to invade Panama .
When a reporter asked if `` it was really worth it to send people to their death '' for the military objectives , Bush declared that Defense Department officials had been candid about the potential for casualties , adding : `` And every human life is precious and yet I have to answer , yes , it has been worth it . ''
The aide said the President had made up his mind to take some kind of action against Noriega even before the Sunday afternoon White House meeting at which he decided to launch a massive military strike .
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the President may stop off at the military hospital in San Antonio where servicemen wounded in Panama are being treated .
`` But he 's genuinely pleased about the way the military performed , and he has assured himself that what he is doing is the right thing and realistic under the circumstances . ''
His tendency to minimize the significance of events and dampen expectations might not serve him well during a military crisis .
The United States stages a massive military invasion of Panama , a tiny sovereign country , and installs its chosen candidate as the new head of state .

Myanmar 's -LSB- Burma 's -RSB- ruling military junta may release opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , under house arrest since July 1989 , in July this year , a Myanmar official said Monday -LSB- 17 January -RSB- .
THE fate of Burma 's detained popular leader Aung San Suu Kyi remains uncertain despite earlier speculation she will be released in July , five years after she was placed under house arrest .
There remains ambiguity over the state of Suu Kyi 's detention and her freedom , but a group of Slorc 's legal advisers told visiting foreign reporters on Friday that she will not be released when her five-year term of detention expires on July 20 .
They also strongly rejected the term `` detention '' used to describe Suu Kyi 's house arrest , arguing that it is only a `` restriction '' and that the military rulers have been dealing with her `` leniently '' .
Five of Slorc 's legal experts led by Chief Justice U Aung Toe and Attorney General U Tha Tun told a press conference Suu Kyi 's house arrest `` was not decided by the court `` , but by the `` existing laws which stipulate that her restriction period will not be construed as expiring on July 20 this year `` .
They believe Slorc will amend the laws to extend Suu Kyi 's detention and that she will not be released until a new Constitution is drafted and promulgated , with many provisions that will restrict her political role in Burmese politics .
It is clear from the detailed and lengthy opening speech of Chief Justice U Aung Toe , also chairman of the National Convention 's work committee , that all the guidelines and qualifications for a new charter have already been devised to bar Suu Kyi , a mother of two sons whose husband is a British professor at Oxford University , from running in the presidential elections .
They cited the government 's refusal to release Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest for five years .
Gen Charan said he did not know if Aung San Suu Kyi might be released , but he disagreed with the criticism , saying there was no reason for the junta to play a trick on the minorities as it might stir hatred and resistance .
In May 1990 national elections the National League for Democracy -LRB- NLD -RRB- , led by Aung San Suu Kyi , won a landslide victory , but the military junta has refused to hand over power .
Officials said Kakizawa also called for the release of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
Detained Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi won the award last year .
The isolationists contend that international pressure , and Burma 's shortage of cash , is partly responsible for the Slorc 's reforms ; They say pressure should be maintained to secure the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the detained opposition leader .
'Without the participation of Aung San Suu Kyi , the national convention will be regarded as a hoax by the majority of the Burmese people , ' says one Burmese doctor in Rangoon .
The chief architect of Mandalay 's free-wheeling economic policy is General Tun Kyi , who until recently was the region 's all-powerful military commander .
'Tun Kyi is the godfather of Mandalay , ' says one Burmese businessman .
The citizens of Mandalay say Gen Tun Kyi has repaired the market and beautified the town ; the Yunnanese have found a short and convenient trade route to the sea , and China is investing in the repair and construction of Burmese roads and bridges .
Gen Tun Kyi has been recalled to Rangoon , ostensibly to become trade minister , but actually , diplomats believe , because his military colleagues feared he was becoming too powerful in his Mandalay fiefdom .
Gen Tun Kyi and his Chinese friends , however , seem to be holding their own .
A CAMPAIGN launched yesterday for the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the detained Burmese opposition leader , has rekindled a fierce debate in Asia about human rights and the merits of Asian countries intervening in their neighbours ' affairs .
The campaign to release Ms Suu Kyi marks a break from the traditional South-East Asian policy of 'constructive engagement ' with Burma .
Burma 's military junta yesterday brushed off international appeals for the release of opposition leader Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and threatened to keep her under house arrest until 1995 .
His statement came a day after Ms Suu Kyi was visited at her Rangoon home by US congressman Mr William Richardson , together with a New York Times reporter and a UN official - the first visit by people other than her family since she was held nearly five years ago .
The international standing of Ms Suu Kyi , her popularity within Burma and her continued defiance are an embarrassment to the junta .
Ms Suu Kyi is a beacon of hope for pro-democracy activists as they watch the junta engineer a new constitution that would allow the armed forces to continue running the country from behind the scenes .
They crushed a popular uprising in 1988 and allowed an election two years later which - to their discomfit - was won convincingly by Ms Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy .
Col Kyaw Win said yesterday Ms Suu Kyi would 'interfere with politics and create unrest ' if she were set free within Burma .
Ms Suu Kyi has challenged the junta to respect the results of the election .
Today Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace prize winner , marks the beginning of her sixth year under house arrest in Rangoon .
The visit by Mr David Dain , an assistant under-secretary of state , followed some 'potentially encouraging ' signals from the government , including meetings with the detained opposition leader , Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
Burma 's military dictatorship seems likely to kep Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the Burmese democracy movement , under house arrest for several more years , it was revealed yesterday .
There has been speculation that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , whose family home has been her prison for nearly 6 1/2 years , would be released on January 20 when her current detention order was thought to expire .
National Security Council secretary-general Gen Charan Kunlawanit says he is very satisfied with a compromise reached between Burma 's rulers and some minority groups on a ceasefire ahead of peace talks .
The Burmese junta recently held peace talks with Kachin rebels in the north and with the Mon .
Earlier , the Karen National Union -LSB- KNU -RSB- , the strongest anti- Rangoon minority group , called on the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council to hold peace talks on equal terms with all minority groups to ensure rights and freedom in all economic social and political fields .
`` Thailand always supports peace talks and clings to the belief that any slaughter of minorities should be condemned by the world community . ''
One thorn still obstructs the peace in Burma , according to Gen Charan , as the junta has to attack the strongholds of opium warlord Khun Sa , who is notoriously influential in Shan State .
He also called current peace negotiations between the council and ten ethnic minority groups an example of `` divide and conquer '' and added : `` There is still a policy of Burmanization . ''
The nobel peace prize winner has been held under house arrest without charge since July 1989 .
MS RIGOBERTA Menchu Tum , the Guatemalan Indian and human rights activist , yesterday won the 1992 Nobel peace prize .
The Nobel committee said Ms Menchu , a 33-year-old Mayan , stood out 'as a vivid symbol of peace and reconciliation across ethnic , cultural and social dividing lines , in her own country , on the American continent and in the world ' .
Ms Menchu is the ninth woman to win the Nobel peace prize .
Mr Francis Sejersted , chairman of the Nobel committee , said the award to Ms Menchu - on the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the new world - 'was not a coincidence , but it was not the only factor ' in the selection .
Ms Menchu said last week she would use the prize to set up a foundation in her father 's memory .
No- one believes that the Slorc , which ignored the results of a 1990 election in which the opposition National League for Democracy won more than 80 per cent of the seats , has any intention of yielding power .
But prosperity and the fragile peace on the border have come at a price .
Eight Nobel Peace Prize winners , after being refused entry to Burma , came to neighbouring Thailand to start the campaign for their fellow laureate .
The campaign has won support from the Clinton administration and prizewinners unable to come to Thailand , such as Mother Teresa and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev , former Soviet president .
But Mr Chuan Leekpai , the civilian prime minister elected on a liberal ticket last year , has allowed all the Nobel laureates into the country .
The visiting laureates , including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa , northern Ireland peace campaigners Ms Betty Williams and Ms Mairead Maguire , and an Amnesty International representative , are to meet Burmese refugees today .

The new law , which has not received as much public attention as another measure lowering the legal standard for intoxication from a blood-alcohol level of 0.1 % to 0.08 % , provides that the courts can order cars sold upon a third drunk-driving conviction over a seven-year period .
`` Basically , the 0.08 %
Hilbert , an unemployed former firefighter , was sentenced after pleading guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol , driving with a blood-alcohol content above the legal limit of 0.10 % and driving with a revoked license , all misdemeanors .
Carey was given a breath test at the scene that showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.19 % , almost twice the state 's legal limit for intoxication of 0.10 % , authorities said .
A breath test showed the driver , Harold Keith Lone , had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27 % , more than three times the new legal limit of 0.08 % .
Prosecutors said Depardieu 's blood contained twice the legal alcohol limit of 0.08 % after the July 20 accident , which occurred as the actor drove to a hotel after shooting scenes for a new movie .
`` I think there 's no question when it 's .08 % that it is definitely impaired . ''
Under the new law that takes effect Jan. 1 , a driver with .08 % or higher is presumed to be drunk ; however , those with lower levels could also be cited for drunk driving .
Although he felt unimpaired , he had downed enough beer after work that a Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level to register .08 % , the new legal limit .
In the wake of the new .08 %
To their delight , law enforcement officers say the new law -- which lowers the legal limit from .10 % to .08 % -- is allowing them to snare a new kind of drunk driver .
almost 10 % , or 11,000 , drivers arrested statewide so far this year by the California Highway Patrol had a level of .10 % or less . -RRB-
But the tougher laws have also had some unintended consequences : Many more drivers are choosing to fight the charges in court , believing they are unimpaired at the .08 %
`` It 's understandable that a driver feels that way , but from a scientist 's point of view , a driver is impaired at .08 % , '' said Dr. Lonnie Bristow , a physician and trustee with the American Medical Assn. , which prefers a .05 % legal limit .
`` Increased conviction is increased deterrent as far as we are concerned -- the .08
Traffic experts believe this sanction will probably do more to keep drunk drivers off the road than the .08 %
Under the license suspension law , officers can seize the licenses of those arrested on suspicion of drunk driving if their blood alcohol level is .08 % or higher .
The correct level is .08 % .
Blood-alcohol tests administered to Covey after the accident showed that he did have a blood-alcohol level above 0.10 % , the level at which a driver is legally intoxicated , Yackle said .
A 150-pound person could have three drinks in an hour and still register below the .10
California is one of only four states to adopt the restrictive .08
Sen. Bill Leonard -LRB- R - Big Bear -RRB- , the author of the law , said medical evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that people are intoxicated when their blood alcohol level reaches .08 % .
The amount of alcohol that will produce a .08
But for a person who weighs between 90 and 149 pounds , three drinks consumed during a two-hour period is almost certain to produce a blood alcohol level of .08 , according to the CHP .
After years of rejecting the lower level , the Legislature agreed this year to adopt the .08
CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan said the adoption of the .08
The Ventura County district attorney 's office , viewed as one of the toughest in the state in dealing with drunk-driving offenses , plans to aggressively prosecute repeat offenders under the state 's new car forfeiture law , which took effect Monday .
Reviewing other new laws that took effect this week , officials of the district attorney 's office portrayed them generally as a refinement of existing state laws rather than any significant departure from the past .
In December , Hilbert was ordered held in lieu of $ 250,000 bail after a prosecutor said his blood-alcohol level had often been three times the legal limit , adding , `` I can not believe this guy has n't killed someone . ''
A Lancaster woman was sentenced to 16 months in prison Wednesday in the death of a motorcyclist whom she hit while driving under the influence of alcohol .
The report also said that Carey had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1981 and had been attending an alcohol -treatment program since the 1987 accident .
A state Assembly committee will look into the hiring practices and supervision at Laidlaw Transit , the largest school transportation contractor in Los Angeles , following the arrests of two Laidlaw employees accused of driving buses while drunk .
Katz also said several state agencies agreed Monday to improve screening of applicants for jobs as bus drivers .
Katz said representatives of the Department of Justice , the California Highway Patrol and the Department of Motor Vehicles agreed to speed up state fingerprint checks and stop issuing temporary driver certifications as of June 1 .
Currently , 618 drivers in the state are working with temporary permits while their backgrounds are checked .
However , some district administrators expressed concern that the state 's actions could lead to a shortage of drivers .
On Monday , Daley said he also plans to train staff members who have contact with drivers , such as dispatchers , field supervisors and trainers , in ways to detect and report suspected drug or alcohol use .
He said mixing alcohol and the transport of children is `` unacceptable , unconscionable . ''
Under a plea agreement with prosecutors , Kenneth C. Swofford , 55 , who plays the principal in the show , could be sentenced June 13 to a maximum of four years in state prison for the accident that left George Charouhas , 37 , disabled with a spine injury , said Deputy Dist .
The level of injuries in this case lead me to believe that this ought to be a state prison sentence . ''
A Ventura County woman had a blood-alcohol content more than twice the level of legal drunkenness when she was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving last week , authorities said , the night before she was arrested again after an accident that killed three young men and injured two others .
The tests are being conducted on her blood .
The posted speed limit on winding Aliso Hills Drive , where the accident occurred Saturday , is 45 m.p.h. , said Daily , who added that samples of France 's blood were taken three hours after the crash .
Raider safety Stacey Toran had a blood-alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he drove his car into a tree and was killed , the coroner 's office said Thursday .
The results of the toxicological examination put Toran 's blood alcohol level at .32 percent when he was killed shortly before midnight last Saturday , county coroner 's spokesman Bob Dambacher said .
To reach a blood alcohol level of .32 percent , a 154-pound person would have to quickly drink 10 bottles of beer or 10 ounces of whiskey , according to the American Medical Association 's `` Family Medical Guide . ''
Toran weighed about 200 pounds , so he presumably would have had to have consumed more alcohol to reach the .32
`` Wow , that 's getting almost to the unconscious level , '' said Dr. Ernest Noble , professor of alcohol studies at UCLA .
Noble said that a .40 percent level usually causes death by alcohol poisoning .
Traffic accidents claimed at least six lives in Los Angeles County over the Labor Day weekend and caused more than 50 fatalities across the state -- a pace that appeared to be slightly greater than last year .
CHP Officer Andy Guitierrez attributed some of the increase in drunk driving arrests to a recent lowering of the state 's legal blood alcohol limit .
Aguilar and other medical officials gathered in front of the medical center 's emergency room to decry the latest loss of state funding for Los Angeles County 's trauma care system and urge passage of a state liquor tax initiative .
`` The way things are going now , the system 's going to die , '' said Dr. Michael Trainor , an emergency room doctor and president of the state chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians .
Rausis ' blood-alcohol specimen measured 0.01 % alcohol by weight , according to a spokeswoman for the CHP .
Suspicion of alcohol involvement stemmed from an ice chest containing beer that was reportedly scattered across I-8 after Rausis ' car overturned .
Deukmejian said he will also consider signing another drunk driving bill -- one that would impose an even tighter standard for truck drivers by making a blood alcohol level of .04 the legal limit for those who drive for a living .
Under the proposal , commercial drivers who are caught with any amount of alcohol at all in their system would be kept off the job for 24 hours .
Failure to have those standards in place by 1994 would cost the state an estimated $ 43 million in lost federal highway funds the first year and $ 86 million each year thereafter .
Deukmejian said he has not decided whether he agrees with efforts in Congress to tighten drunk driving standards even more -- to a blood alcohol level of .05 % .
`` Studies indicate that when somebody 's blood alcohol content level is .05 % or higher for most individuals their driving is impaired , '' Deukmejian said .
This chart shows the percentage of alcohol in the blood , for various weight levels , after one hour from the time the first drink was consumed .
Kaz Deyna , a member of five Socker championship teams , had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit when he crashed into a parked truck and died on Sept. 1 , the San Diego County Coroner 's Office said Tuesday .
His license was temporarily suspended after the third conviction , but , according to state Department of Motor Vehicles records , he was driving legally at the time of the accident .
I think he knew what his limit was .
Wendlandt was arrested in Milwaukee on Feb. 10 , after he was in a street fight , authorities there said .
Not only was he arrested , but he was stripped of his driver 's license , a second result of the state 's new and tougher drunk driving laws .
Only three other states -- Utah , Maine and Oregon -- have legal blood alcohol limits as low as California .
As a result , more drivers have been arrested on state highways than ever before , and drunk driving convictions are approaching an all-time high .

The controversy over the lower limit also has been responsible for a rise of as much as 20 % in jury trials in some areas , such as Orange County .
At the lower blood alcohol levels drivers do n't `` feel they were under the influence .
`` But obviously we would n't be picking up the .08s
After being pulled over , he scored a low but still illegal blood alcohol level on the hand-held breath analysis device .
Usually , the introduction of a new law heightens awareness of a problem , which , in turn , tends to boost arrests and convictions , said Cliff Helander , research manager of the DMV 's alcohol research unit .
Many experts say that by the time an intoxicated driver is punished by the legal system , he has long since forgotten his crime .
But many others say the double punch of yanking a license and the lower drinking limit is effective .
Lowering the blood alcohol limit for suspected drunk drivers in California has caused an increase in the number of arrests and conviction rates statewide .
Alcohol limit -- A headline in Monday 's editions of The Times incorrectly stated the legal blood alcohol limit for California motorists .
`` Our issue is not alcohol , it 's driving while under the influence of alcohol , '' Roark said .
Other party tips include having someone play the role of bartender rather than have the alcohol free flowing , and to stop serving alcohol an hour before the party 's end , Roark said .
Under this new law , put into effect Jan. 1 , there were 16 % more drivers arrested in Southern California for drunk driving on state highways , and 10 % more drivers were convicted of the crime during the first 10 months of this year than during the same period in 1989 .
The motorcyclist linked to the death of a jogger along Sweetwater Road in Bonita on Nov. 5 has been charged with one count of vehicular manslaughter and two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol , the district attorney 's office said .
If convicted on the charges , all felonies , Covey could be sentenced to a maximum of four years in state prison , a district attorney 's spokeswoman said .
As the 1990s begin , law enforcement officers will be armed with a new blood alcohol standard that will reduce the amount of alcohol one can drink before being presumed drunk .
But that same person would now have to limit the number of drinks to two in an hour to stay below the new standard .

Yesterday 's strong May figure of 9 per cent , compared with April 's 8.9 per cent , meant growth remained well above the Bundesbank 's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent 1992 target and dashed hopes of an imminent interest rate cut .
This was still significantly above the 1992 target growth rate of between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent .
The bank set a target of 3.5 - 5.5 per cent for the year , but concedes this target can not be met .
The Bundesbank announced that German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 8.5 per cent in February after a 9.0 per cent rise in January .
NEWS of higher than expected German monetary growth led to early strength in the D -Mark and a slightly weaker dollar yesterday , writes Peter John .
The market had been hoping that Germany 's M3 , the measure of money that includes cash savings and long-term deposits of up to four years , would show an annualised growth of around 8.5 per cent .
'They are also keeping an eye on the level of unemployment and the relatively slow industrial production growth and it seems likely that there will be a cut , just later than anticipated . '
At yesterday morning 's repurchase tender , the minimum accepted rate fell to 14.15 per cent , down 65 basis points from the highs it touched last week as fears of a devaluation swept the market .
German M3 money supply growth is unlikely to have slowed significantly last month .
In April the year-on-year rate of growth dropped to 8.8 per cent from 9.4 per cent in March .
Economists are forecasting an annual rate of inflation of 4.3 per cent in May , from a revised 4.6 per cent in April .
In the first four months of the year they accelerated to an annual rate of 5.7 per cent following rent increases .
During the week : Germany , May import prices -LRB- up 0.2 per cent on month , down 2.1 per cent on year -RRB- , May M3 -LRB- up 8.5 per cent -RRB- , June preliminary cost of living -LRB- up 0.3 per cent on month , up 4.3 per cent on year -RRB- ; Italy , May trade balance -LRB- L2.1 trillion deficit -RRB- , June , CPI - major cities -LRB- up 5.8 per cent on year -RRB- , April cumulative PSBR -LRB- L55 trillion -RRB- , May bank lending -LRB- up 15 per cent on year -RRB- , May hourly earnings -LRB- up 6.5 per cent on year -RRB- ; Belgium , May CPI .
Too great an easing of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve may yet turn a sluggish recovery into rapid growth and accelerating inflation .
But policy is doubly difficult to judge at present because of the erratic behaviour of the central bankers ' favoured leading indicators of future inflation : the growth of broad monetary aggregates .
Yet broad money -LRB- M2 -RRB- , which also includes a variety of interest-bearing time deposits , is still growing very slowly , and is barely above the lower limit of the Fed 's 2.5 - 6.5 per cent growth target .
Yet broad money growth may be misleadingly depressed .
Stripping out small time deposits and money market mutual funds from M2 raises its growth rate to M1 proportions , as the left-hand charts shows .
While M1 growth remains at historically high levels , the growth of its favoured money supply average - M2 plus certificates of deposit - has collapsed .
The BOJ , anxious to resist another interest rate cut , argues that this slowdown results from shift of savings into Postal Saving deposits which are excluded from broad money .
But growth of both bank lending and broad liquidity , which includes the postal savings , is also sluggish .
In Germany , broad money growth rates suggest that inflation , not recession , remains the main threat .
The year-on-year growth rates have risen sharply in recent months .
But the peculiar measure of broad money growth rates stressed by the Bundesbank paints a more alarming picture .
Rapid money growth in December and January meant that the annualised monthly rate was already 8.9 per cent in January .
It has since remained outside the target range .
There are a number of reasons why German broad money growth might be artificially inflated .
Yet the main force propelling M3 growth , according to the Bundesbank , is the volume of bank lending to companies and individuals .
But M3 growth is not expected to fall within the Bundesbank 's target range in 1992 .
This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money , a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield .
Narrow Broad Short Long Equity Money Money Interest Interest Market
All growth rates refer to the seasonally adjusted series except for Japan and Italy .
However , while M3 clearly has grown much faster than the German central bank would like , it is not so evident why .
In March , the growth rate was an annual 9.4 per cent after 8.6 per cent in February and 8.9 per cent in January .
The rate is expected to slow , but there is little likelihood the Bundesbank will meet its target .
Curiously , M3 was already out of line at the start of the year ; the target is based on the average for the fourth quarter of 1991 , but December 's rapid growth put the 1992 starting point well above that level .
Nevertheless , the Bundesbank does not intend to make the target range higher simply to make it easier to reach .
Its goal for M3 -LRB- comprising mainly cash , savings , and short-term deposits -RRB- is a firm expression of its intent to maintain stability .
Why is the target not being met now ?
Each year , the Bundesbank assesses Germany 's potential for economic growth and adds a few percentage points for expected inflation and the rate of monetary circulation .
The result is the M3 goal , with the range representing acceptable upper and lower variations .
The bank 's determination to stick to its target range is its counter-strategy to the high , and inflationary , state spending and borrowing wave embarked on to support the east German economy .
Thus , credit demand from the private sector , up at an annual rate of 12 per cent in the past six months , is less subject to the Bundesbank 's control .
Also helping propel M3 along more quickly than usual are : lower profit levels , leading companies to borrow more at a time of economic slackness to finance investments ; increased lending for consumption and residential property deals ; and the effect of high interest rates in encouraging funds to be placed in short-term deposits .
All this points to the question of how seriously M3 's growth should be taken .
Now , Germany 's Lombard rate is at 9.75 per cent and the discount rate at 8 per cent .
Inflation has moderated to an annual rate of 4.5 per cent in March , but the Bundesbank is obviously unhappy about wage trends and the vigour of M3 .
Of immediate concern is the impact of monetary growth on inflation , which the bank wants to see below 4 per cent this year and around 2 per cent later .
In the 1970s , the average rise in the money supply outpaced real potential growth in the economy by more than 6.5 per cent .
In the 1980s , M3 grew less rapidly and so did prices .
'Prices have tended to follow the growth of the money stock with a lag of about two to three years , ' the bank said .
Growth in M3 , the target measure of money supply , in France is expected to have risen further in March following February 's increase .
In February M3 was 3.5 per cent up on a year ago and the median forecast for March is a rise of 0.5 per cent .

Almost every member country of the European exchange rate mechanism will choose to grit its teeth and bear the pain , while the dynamic of European politics will require the UK government to follow suit .
The acceleration of Germany 's money supply following unification , the rise in its short-term interest rates , the virtual disappearance of short-term interest rate differentials between Germany , France and the UK , and the subsequent divergence between high European interest rates and falling rates in the US and Japan , these are all apparent .
If the Bundesbank is serious about meeting this target range , then it will almost certainly have to raise the European interest rate floor sometime in the next few months .
A series of interest rate cuts in the US and Japan mean that the stance of monetary policy , measured by yield gap between short and long-term interest rates , is now much looser in these countries than in Europe .
With the money supply growing well beyond the target for 1992 , the Bundesbank 's credibility is clearly at stake - both in the financial community and among Germany 's stability-conscious citizens .
Nor does the Bonn government , struggling to put its finances in order under the weight of the high cost of unification , want to see the German economy hit by another interest rate blast .
So he and others reckon a further half-point rise in the discount rate to 8.5 per cent is most likely .
This would narrow the gap with the more important Lombard rate -LRB- now 9.75 per cent -RRB- , which would be left alone .
'Most attention is focused on the discount rate or access to Lombard credits . '
Much of the pressure behind the 9 per cent annualised growth in M3 this year has come from high lending to finance east Germany 's economic reconstruction ; investment subsidies make a large part of this insensitive to interest rates .
Moreover , M3 has been swollen by large holdings of the D -Mark in eastern Europe .
It is unlikely that the target will be changed .
So the real concentration is on ensuring the right conditions for slower M3 growth in 1993 .
'It would be best if they sit on their hands , bite their lips , and say they will wait until M3 comes down , ' says Mr Nigel Rendell , economist with stockbrokers James Capel in London .
Since the cuts in the discount rate from 8.75 to 8.25 per cent and the Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.50 per cent come as the west German economy is weakening and the east German economy recovering more slowly than hoped , Mr Schlesinger , the Bundesbank 's president , was able to state that the consequences of the move 'should certainly fit into the present situation ' .
Also giving the rate cuts - the first since 1987 - a domestic gloss was the hope that Chancellor Kohl 's call for a solidarity pact , including low wage deals , with industry , unions , and regional states , to sort out the problems of unification and its financing would bear fruit .
Thus Mr Schlesinger said the rate reductions , accompanied by a move to lower money market rates from 9.7 to 9.2 per cent by moving to a fixed rate tender at this week 's securities repurchase operation , were also 'a certain advance concession ' to possible changes in wage and fiscal policies .
'You can forget M3 and so forth if a situation like last week continues .
Not that M3 , the broad monetary aggregate , has been forgotten .
per cent target range and inflated by the pressures of unification , has been a main reason for Germany 's high interest rates .
Yesterday , Mr Schlesinger said M3 growth may have eased slightly from the 8.5 per cent annualised rate of July , but the target would not be achieved in 1992 .
'It is the money market rate which defines the problem on the foreign exchange market , not the Lombard rate ' .
His deputy , Mr Hans Tietmeyer , said the rate cuts were not made under pressure from EC partners .
While the Bundesbank is concerned that the growth rate of M3 , the broad monetary aggregate - already running well above its target range this year - should not be accelerated by the effect of the massive currency intervention , some economists think it could act more vigorously to remove liquidity .
Last week economists forecast that an annualised expansion rate of more than 10 per cent could be recorded for M3 this month because of the liquidity created by unprecedented D -Mark central bank sales throughout Europe in recent weeks .
The Bundesbank cut interest rates two weeks ago as part of the lira devaluation package in the European exchange rate mechanism -LRB- ERM -RRB- .
But many German economists reckon it will now keep the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent and the discount rate at 8.25 per cent .
Now they must live with the targeting of D -Mark M3 , instead .
The question is whether many will come to condemn the Bundesbank 's present targetry , as they do the targeting of sterling M3 in the early 1980s .
The Bundesbank argues that its attachment to D -Mark M3 reflects the solid empirical relationship between monetary expansion and inflation some three years later .
The growth rate of D -Mark M3 is slipping back , but too slowly .
The principal motor of M3 expansion is credit expansion , most of it medium and long term .
In the last six months , complains the Bundesbank , the annual rate of credit expansion to the private sector was 11 per cent .
The American authorities can , if they , wish , ignore the exchange rate slide .
THE BUNDESBANK has fuelled expectations of a further cut in interest rates by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in the growth of money supply .
German economists say the German central bank is drawing back from its earlier insistence that the M3 measure of money supply - which includes cash in circulation , current accounts and short-term deposits - should be regarded as the most important indicator of domestic monetary stability .
German economists , however , say Bundesbank statements this week on special factors affecting M3 growth and a clear policy by the bank in recent days to keep very short-term interest rates below 9 per cent are possible precursors to further cuts in the Lombard and discount rates .
They follow a rising tide of criticism from German economists at the bank 's excessively rigid adherence to the M3 measure of money supply on the ground that it has been distorted by the processes of unification .
Mr Tietmeyer said that the Bundesbank was 'very conscious that the discussion about the measurement of the growth in money supply is influenced by some special considerations .
'They include not only the expansion of credit in east Germany , and the definition of a money supply target after reunification , but also the quality of the M3 measure of money supply as an indicator , given an inverse interest-rate structure , and the effects of currency inflows . '
The inverse interest rate structure refers to the fact that the bank 's high interest rate policy has kept short-term rates above long-term rates , encouraging investors to switch to short-term deposits , which are themselves part of the M3 measure .
The news came against a background of further currency turbulence as Norway decided to cut the krone 's link to the Ecu , sparking further speculative pressure against the weaker European exchange rate mechanism currencies such as the Danish krone and the French franc .
Mr Helmut Schlesinger , the Bundesbank president , said there was no room for an easing in interest rates , and the central bank left its discount rate at 8.25 per cent while its Lombard rate remained at 9.5 per cent .
The bund market had expected the money supply target range to be raised .
Mr Otmar Issing , Bundesbank board member , said German M3 money supply growth slowed in November , and was quoted as saying it would be below 10 per cent .
The provisional figure of 10.2 per cent for annualised growth for October was revised to 10.3 per cent .
The decision by Norway to sever the Norwegian krone 's link to the Ecu yesterday put pressure on the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism .
Dealers said the UK credit figures , which showed a Pounds 76m rise in the amount of credit outstanding by British consumers , provided a slightly more bullish picture of the UK economy , with the result that hopes of a base rate cut faded .
French M3 money supply grew by 0.2 per cent in October , giving year-on-year growth of 5.7 per cent - compared with 5.3 per cent in September .
Dealers said bunds opened on a relatively firm note following Sunday 's Swiss referendum vote , which rejected a plan for a European Economic Area and led to some uncertainty about tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism .
Japanese government bonds ended slightly firmer , helped by lower money market rates and hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate .
Dealers said the market was hoping to see a cut in the Official Discount Rate , especially as Friday 's quarterly Tankan report on business confidence is expected to show that the Japanese economy is still in a weak state .
The unsecured overnight call money rate slipped 1/32 to 3 27/32 per cent yesterday , and dealers are waiting to see whether some of the commercial banks will follow Sanwa Bank 's example and cut their short-term prime rates .
FRANKFURT ended yesterday 's floor trading with the DAX index at the day 's low of 1 , 510.28 , down 20.61 , reflecting interest rate and currency worries and poor performances from the car maker , Volkswagen , and the steel group , Thyssen .
The Bundesbank has revised the annualised M3 money supply growth rate for September upwards to 9.3 per cent from 9.1 per cent , Reuter reported from Frankfurt yesterday .
M3 rose by an annualised 8.8 per cent in August .
Economists had expected the rate of growth in M3 to fall significantly from December .
But the annualised , seasonally adjusted 2.3 per cent drop in M3 - following an 8.7 per cent rise in December - took observers by surprise when it was announced yesterday , prompting an increase in German bond prices in expectation of further interest rate cuts .
The Bundesbank said the figure was distorted , taking care to emphasise that the drop reflected a number of special factors , chiefly the reversal of the currency flows which had bloated M3 growth in the autumn of last year .
The Bundesbank 's currency market interventions helped send annualised M3 growth to a record 10.3 per cent last October .
Another reason was purely statistical - the Bundesbank calculates the growth with reference to the previous three month 's figures .
As these were exceptionally high , it was inevitable that the January annualised figure would be vastly improved on the December M3 number .
Economists were , however , expecting growth of around 4 per cent , not a fall .
Despite the Bundesbank 's attempts to play down the significance of the number , economists were encouraged , predicting that the Bundesbank would be able to meet its growth target for M3 this year .
The target was subsequently raised to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for 1993 .
The Bundesbank said that on a straightforward year-on-year basis , M3 - which includes cash , current accounts and short-term deposits - grew by 7.5 per cent .
Norway 's central bank cut the key overnight lending rate to its lowest level since the rate was introduced in 1986 .
The central bank also lowered the rate for overnight deposits , the credit rate , to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent .
The key rate reached 25 per cent last November during turbulence in the Scandinavian currency markets .

Talking about the Grammys disturbs Bill Whitten .
`` I 'm just as much a part of the music industry as Michael Jackson , '' Whitten said .
Whitten 's name is rarely recognized outside the music business , yet his clothing designs are known the world over .
With each moon-walking step and hand gesture , Michael Jackson displayed the Whitten style .
`` It was very simple , '' Whitten calmly explained .
Whitten dressed Elton John in extravagant capes and electric boots .
Neil Diamond was the first performer to find Whitten , back in 1974 .
Whitten had opened a custom shirt business called Workroom 27 .
It was n't long before Diamond became an advocate of Whitten 's custom-designed clothes , and he spread the word .
When it did , Whitten went from leasing one room to buying the entire building .
Whitten 's business crested as more and more bands demanded a personalized stage style .
The store , called Bill Whitten , is scheduled to open March 4 and will carry everything from pajamas to evening wear for men and women .
Whitten sews metal sequins on 150-year-old , hand-loomed fabric from the Far East to make jackets .
Whitten 's most inventive decorations appear on tuxedos .
But Whitten says the drums of the underground beat louder in West Los Angeles than they do in Beverly Hills .
If other cities want a Bill Whitten store , he 's only too happy to oblige .
But , there is no Grammy award for the category of costume design .
So , at tonight 's televised presentation , when more than 60 awards will be handed out -- some for categories as esoteric as album notes -- there wo n't be a Grammy for the designer who put Michael Jackson in a single rhinestone glove .
Today he regularly suits up Michael Jackson , Lionel Richie , his old friend Neil Diamond and others such as magicians Siegfried and Roy .
Finally , he decided to give into the demand by opening a store on Melrose Avenue .

Science fiction has long been filled with chilling scenarios of the future in which evil leaders try to engineer a master race of genetically perfect human beings .
The tools to accomplish such a feat are slowly moving out of the realm of fiction , however , as geneticists around the world struggle to identify and decode all of the genes contained in the human body .
Scientists at a recent conference on gene mapping frequently pointed out that , once they determine how a human being is made , they will have little control over how their discoveries are used .
Gene mapping is one of the hottest areas of science now , and a unique international effort has been undertaken to locate and define all of the chemical instructions that create a human being , collectively known as the human genome .
The United States has announced plans to invest more than $ 3 billion over the next 15 years in the National Institutes of Health 's gene-mapping project , making it the largest in the world .
France also has a well-advanced gene-mapping program .
The European Community plans to invest $ 20 million over the next two years on a genome project .
`` It is very clear that the human genome initiative has captured the imagination of the world , '' said Norton Zinder , chairman of the advisory committee to the NIH 's human genome program .
Researchers expect that once the genome is defined , medical science can apply the findings to the diagnosis and cure of more than 4,000 human diseases known to stem from gene defects .
The NIH , under the auspices of Watson and Zinder , have set up a working group on ethical issues connected to the genome project led by Nancy Wexler , an associate professor of clinical neuropsychology at Columbia University and president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation .
Jeremy Rifkin , president of the Foundation on Economic Trends and an outspoken opponent of genetic engineering , has organized a coalition of 70 consumer representatives including Ralph Nader and National Organization for Women President Molly Yard to lobby for the creation of a permanent congressional board to `` address the issues of genetic discrimination , privacy and eugenics caused by the human gene-mapping project . ''
In West Germany , the environmentally focused Greens Party is strongly opposed to the genome project , claiming that the research could lead to human eugenic experiments similar to those carried out by the Nazi regime .
However , scientists note that the regulations imposed by individual countries may be meaningless for a project that is so international in scope .
Zinder said the NIH group has been approached by several Third World nations interested in sharing research efforts and results .

A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries -LRB- MHI -RRB- said that production facilities will not be increased , even though the company could take orders , and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries -LRB- IHI -RRB- , with its facilities booked until 1993 , said that it built 10 ships last year , will build 10 ships this year , and plans to build 10 ships in financial 1992 .
MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries yesterday became the latest Japanese company to announce a big cut in its workforce in response to the worsening Japanese economy .
This new approach is best illustrated by the recent decision of Nippon Yusen , a shipper in the group , to buy South Korean ships for the first time , rather than from its usual supplier , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries .
That is a thing of the past , ' says Mr Tsuda Yoshida , managing director of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries .
But the long queue of buyers at Japanese yards has just forced even the patriotic Nippon Yusen to turn to Taiwan for a new bulk carrier .
'We have n't bought a ship from outside Japan since the end of the Second World War .
Shipbuilding companies now complain that the biggest problem is not a lack of orders , but a shortage of staff , and they are known to be routinely turning down orders in the confident expectation that ship prices , up 17.9 per cent in the year to end March , will continue to rise .
At the NKK Corporation yard at Tsu on the central coast , the order books are full until April 1994 , and Mr Heiichiro Miyazaki , the company 's managing director , suggested that increasing demand is likely to mean supply shortages and strong prices in the second half of the decade .
Japanese shipbuilders are generally relieved that the era of savage competition with South Korea is over .
One company official said that there is now pricing 'harmony ' among the world 's two largest shipbuilding nations , which have close to 75 per cent of the market - Japanese companies estimate that they have about 48 per cent and South Korean firms about 25 per cent .
While Japanese companies insist that supply has been limited by a 24 per cent cut in capacity administered by the transport ministry , modernisation of facilities has allowed the yards to build more ships per dock .
It is clear that Japanese builders are not planning such an increase , as it would conflict with the general perception in the market of limited supply and with hopes for a steady increase in prices over the next few years .
This company expects pre-tax profits to more than double to Y5bn in the year to March 1991 .
JAPANESE and South Korean shipbuilders have emerged from the troubled waters of recession aware that the most significant threat to their dominance of the international shipbuilding industry is rivalry between them .
While they have survived the market turbulence of the past decade , they no longer regard the European industry as a serious threat , and Japanese builders are turning down orders in the expectation that vessel prices can only increase .
Government assistance has certainly played an important role in reviving the two industries , but Japanese and Korean companies now control their own destiny , having last year captured about 65 per cent of the world market .
Replacement demand for oil tankers built in the early and mid-1970s has combined with new demand for vessels to fill company order books - Japanese companies had an order backlog last September 14.2 per cent higher than the previous year .
Japanese builders have a natural advantage because of about 18 new LNG projects likely to produce demand for vessels , 10 have been backed by Japanese energy companies , while South Korean utility companies are funding three .
The Japanese industry has survived in spite of fears that shipbuilding would be transferred to lower-cost countries such as China , largely by the introduction of labour-saving technology .
In 1973 , a very large crude carrier -LRB- VLCC -RRB- took a Japanese company about 1m man-hours to build , but the figure is now close to 270,000 man-hours for the most efficient yard run by Hitachi Zosen , one of the leading builders .
The second advantage for the Japanese companies is that they are essentially rebuilding the fleets of the large Japanese shipping lines .
These shippers have traditionally placed orders with Japanese builders , without much regard to cost , which is now about 10 per cent higher than Korean or Taiwanese yards .
It was a measure of the Japanese yards ' confidence that Nippon Yusen , the Japanese flag carrier , last year ordered two bulk carriers from a Taiwanese company , the China Shipbuilding Corporation , the first it has ordered from outside Japan since the end of the Second World War .
Nippon Yusen said Japanese yards had told it they would not be free to handle that type of vessel for two or three years .
The determination of Japanese companies to limit supply has created opportunities for Korea .
'The Japanese can not continue to expand , ' says Mr Cho Choong Hooy , executive vice-president for sales at Hyundai Heavy Industries , Korea 's largest builder .
The effects of improved labour relations are clearly visible on the company 's accounts .
This has removed a traditional advantage for the very punctual Japanese yards and reduces the threat of competition from Chinese yards which have also earned a reputation for tardiness .
Japanese and Korean builders expect longer-term but limited competition from China and some competition in LNG carrier construction from French builders , which had dominated the sector two decades ago .
Having established themselves as the world 's second largest shipbuilders , the Korean yards now have become less aggressive competitors .
Japanese executives say that Korean companies now understand the importance of 'harmony ' in the industry - the implication is that the deep discounting of the past is over .
'It used to be that the Koreans would ask you what your best price had been from the Japanese and then they would just offer you 10 per cent less ' , said one foreign shipping executive in Seoul .
The company , Japan 's largest heavy machinery manufacturer , said it would reduce the number of employees at its Mihama plant in Hiroshima by about 10 per cent , or close to 400 workers , to meet an equivalent fall in demand for products made at the plant .
Last autumn , the company sent a number of employees working at its machine-tool plants temporarily to Mitsubishi Motors , a fellow member of the group .
The downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies , but Japanese companies have been encouraging older employees to retire early , transferring staff to affiliated companies and restricting the intake of graduates .
Intra-group co-operation can be taken less for granted since the on-set of recession in 1991 prompted management across the group to place profitability , rather than gaining market share , as the prime objective , says Mr Masayoshi Hayashikawa , general manager of planning at Mitsubishi Corporation , the trading company near the heart of the group .
The yen 's rise has made Japanese shipbuilding costs 30 per cent higher than South Korea 's .
An independent company might have been forced to dump the project .
Landmark Tower may be a white elephant today , but even the most critical property analysts believe that any company that can afford to continue owning the tower will end up , in a few years , with one of the finest assets in the domestic property market .
An example of how this team-work can still pay dividends is the co-operation between Mitsubishi 's trading , oil exploration and oil refining arms in making , off the coast of Vietnam last June , the largest oil discovery by a Japanese company for 35 years .

However , North Koreans are enriching these materials and producing high-grade uranium and plutonium by using centrifugal separators , which the former Soviet Union gave to North Korea , at an underground nuclear reprocessing plant in Yongbyun .
The IAEA has said the two facilities , located in a nuclear complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang , might yield evidence of how much plutonium North Korea has produced in the past .
They have expressed concern that missing plutonium from the Yongbyon nuclear reactors might have been diverted to produce nuclear bombs .
Despite Tuesday 's agreement , the question of inspecting two unreported nuclear sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex is still pending , presumably for the two sides to discuss later .
Inspections of the six declared facilities in the Yongbyon nuclear complex , some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang , and one site at Kim Il -song University in the North Korean capital are expected to get under way Wednesday .
The issue of inspecting the two undeclared sites at Yongbyon and examining the nuclear fuel rods has been left to the next round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang , which according to North Korean officials is scheduled for March 21 in Geneva .
A senior North Korean official admitted that his country possesses plutonium for research purposes at a radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex , ITAR-TASS News Agency reported from Pyongyang on Monday .
He reportedly said that despite Pyongyang 's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- , the agency 's monitoring equipment at Yongbyon is operating normally and stressed that North Korea will inform the IAEA if the equipment needs replacement .
The basic purpose of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor , constructed through close cooperation with Russia , is to secure the nuclear power generation necessary to develop the country 's economy , he asserted .
International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- inspectors are continuing their activities at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the area , it was reported Thursday .
The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the inspection team has not encountered any problems , they added .
Construction of the Yongbyon nuclear development complex began in 1962 .
Security is so tight that even Kim Il -song has to disembark from his car when entering the Yongbyon complex .
There have been debates as to the type of atomic reactors in Yongbyon , the amount of plutonium they could produce , the kind of reprocessing facilities , and the number of weapons they have possibly developed by now , but almost nothing is known about the people who possibly have participated in those processes .
Subsequently , the `` Korea - USSR Agreement on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy `` was signed in 1959 , and North Korea began creating a nuclear development complex in Yongbyon in 1962 .
It is officially unknown who was the first director of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center -LSB- NRC -RSB- .
According to a scientist who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort , `` Yi Sung -ki was the first director `` of the Yongbyon NRC .
According to Mr. `` B , '' the person who said that Yi Sung-ki did not take part in the North Korean nuclear development program , `` the first director of the Yongbyon NRC was Han In -sok . ''
Mr `` B , '' who said that Han In-sok was the first director of the Yongbyon Atomic Energy Research Center , explained Han 's role in North Korea as follows : `` While at Kim Il -song University -LSB- KISU -RSB- as physics professor , Han In-sok went to Moscow to study the latest nuclear theories for some time .
Following his return home , he served as the second director of the Yongbyon NRC , then as minister of the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry , which was created within the State Administration Ministry in December 1986 .
Suppose North Korea had spent about 4 years making such preparations , the 5-megawatt -class Yongbyon No. 2 atomic reactor was possibly built in early 1980 .
On his return from Moscow , he served as a professor at Pyongsong Institute of Science before moving to the Yongbyon NRC .
Once , there were moves among students to avoid taking the course as those who willingly had entered the course first saw graduates assigned to Yongbyon or military-related research institutes .
Other major research institutes are mostly lactated in the Yongbyon complex .
The Yongbyon nuclear complex was created in the late 1950 's .
Thus , North Korea , with its own technology , embarked on the construction of No. 2 reactor , a 30 megawatt -class reactor by the graphite moderator gas coolant method , in Yongbyon in 1980 , completing it in 1987 .
Yongbyon is geographically very close to Pakchon .
Yongbyon was gradually turned into a secret town .
On this point , Mr. `` A `` said : `` There is a check point at the Kuryong River bridge leading to the Yongbyon complex .
In addition , it is known that there are many underground plants in Taechon , only eight km from Yongbyon , he added .
International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- inspectors are continuing their activities at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the area , it was reported Thursday -LSB- 19 May -RSB- .
North Korea reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- has no right to inspect them .
Gen. Kim reiterated the North Korean position when CNN 's Beijing correspondent , Mike Chinoy , asked why the Stalinist state refuses to let the IAEA inspect its facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex if it has no intention , capability or desire to develop nuclear weapons .
Blix reaffirmed in the telex that it was very important to take samples from the fuel rods of a five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon , some 90 kilometers -LRB- 56 miles -RRB- north of Pyongyang , to measure their radioactivity levels .
In his interview with the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN , Hans Blix , director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency -LSB- IAEA -RSB- , confirmed that North Korea is now constructing another nuclear reprocessing facility within the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon .
Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to inspect two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection -LSB- chonmyon sachal -RSB- of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon .
He said the mere presence of IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon nuclear complex when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5- megawatt reactor is insufficient .
The IAEA had given a deadline of March 25 for the government of Mr Kim Il -sung , a communist dictator , to permit inspections of two storage buildings at Yongbyon , North Korea 's nuclear complex .
IAEA inspectors yesterday completed maintenance work on monitoring equipment installed at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear complex .
The IAEA is likely to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council today after Pyongyang last week blocked inspection tests by the agency at the Yongbyon nuclear complex .
Leaving room for Pyongyang to avert an international crisis , the IAEA called on North Korea to allow the agency 's inspectors to undertake meaningful tests at a radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon , north of the capital , and at other sites .
The international community has suspected North Korea of developing nuclear weapons and I recently obtained a document decisively proving that it already possesses nuclear weapons .
The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear technology .
What draws our attention in the report is North Korea 's nuclear development .
It devotes five pages out of 36 to North Korea 's nuclear development .
The report gives a general picture of North Korea 's nuclear development .
It says : `` The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LSB- DARK -RSB- has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and the DPRK has test-fired medium-range ballistic missiles .
It has also refused to allow nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic organization -LSB- name as received -RSB- .
The report also indicates that North Korea 's threat to the security of Russia , the United States , and Japan is drastically growing .
The section was written about North Korea 's nuclear development for senior officers of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders .
The section entitled `` Technology Information `` says : Now , nine people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear physicists in North Korea .
Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later half of the 1980 's .
At that time , North Korea was engaged in developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with direct assistance of the Soviet Union .
The missile flies at the maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile with nuclear warheads is in the final stage .
At the same time , North Korea is developing Nodong -2 .
The major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads .
According to the report , North Korea now has 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium -239 .
According to Russian nuclear experts , they are enough to manufacture three to five nuclear warheads .
The Soviet Union provided North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium .
The report describes North Korea 's suspected nuclear development as in the `` final stage '' which has attracted attention of the American and European journalists and the world .
Since the report is an official document that the Russian military , which continued to help North Korea 's nuclear development , compiled on the basis of interviews with Russian engineers who returned home from North Korea , it is 100 percent reliable .
In an interview with me , a senior officer with the Military Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed Forces , which compiled the report , gave details of North Korea 's nuclear development .
In the interview , he revealed not only the existence of nuclear arms in North Korea , but fearful facts .
The following are questions and answers : Unidentified officer : `` In my view , nuclear inspections are a ridiculous story .
North Korea has already completed the development of Hiroshima -type atomic bomb and it is widely known among us that North Korea has at least one atomic bomb .
The North Koreans are using Russian scientists to promote the manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the ` Nuclear Development Project ' which they have worked out on their own .
`` According to an analysis by Soviet nuclear physicists in 1992 , it was said that North Korea was promoting a plan designed to produce at least three atomic bombs , similar to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima , by the end of 1994 .
In the past , the Soviet Union provided North Korea with uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well .
The Soviet Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development in North Korea .
Because of the help from the Soviet Union , the north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium .
Roughly speaking , it is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight kilograms of plutonium .
Kato : But , Russia is officially saying it is not supporting North Korean nuclear development .
As is written in the report , Russian technicians are engaged in North Korean nuclear development .
The total number of Russian technicians , who were sent to North Korea , was well over 100 .
They are staying there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their names .
However , judging from this fact , there is no doubt that North Korea is steadily perfecting its missile development . ''
`` Currently , North Korea has three different kinds of missiles , which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads .
They are Scud-A , B and C types which were manufactured in the north under a production license , and they have 300 such missiles in all .
However , what we should pay attention to is the Nodong-2 , which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace Nodong -1 .
Why does North Korea need an ICBM ?
That is because Kim Il -song and Kim Chong-il saw Tomahawk 's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war .
Kato : Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change its missile development plan ?
Previously , North Korea was using a liquid fuel method for all of its missile development .
It is safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry , through the Moscow Embassy in North Korea , to provide it with more advanced missile development technology , including know-how on developing solid- fuel -type missiles .
Whatever the case may be , North Korea 's demands concerning ICBM development technology are persistent and urgent . ''
It may be safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more advanced missile development technology , including know-how of developing missiles with the solid fuel type method .
Whatever the case may be , North Korea 's demand concerning ICBM development technology is persistent and urgent . ''
If what the senior officer said is true , not only Japan but also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of Kim Il - song .
In fact , reportedly , the United States and Russia , fearing North Korea 's suspected nuclear development , have already started preparing for the North Korean threat .
Actually , the senior officer said the report described above has been written on the assumption that the world will be exposed to North Korea 's nuclear threat .
As he said , the report emphasizes that Japan , the United States , and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean threat .
The following are the major points of the report : 1 -RRB- Within the Russian military authorities , there are some groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development .
3 -RRB- Should the military authorities cooperate with North Korea , it would double Japan 's and South Korea 's distrust of Russia .
Therefore , in view of ensuring security , it is extremely dangerous to cooperate with North Korea .
Therefore , it is absurd to cooperate with North Korea in nuclear development .
In conclusion , the report even proposes that the outflow to North Korea of Russian experts for missile development , of materials for missile development , and nuclear resources should be prevented ; that an accord between Russia and North Korea on missile development technology should be abolished ; and that Russia should not help North Korea smuggle its missiles to the third countries .
He said : `` Concerned over the threat of North Korea , including nuclear attack in the Far East and the Pacific region , Japan 's Defense Agency , the Russian Defense Ministry , and the U.S. Department of Defense are conducting meetings to seek a possible tripartite emergency defense system aimed at coping with a North Korean missile attack .
`` Particularly , they have agreed that it is necessary to urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which North Korea is developing secretly .
`` As far as I know , when the summit was held , -LRB- then -RRB- Director General of the Defense Agency Nakanishi , who accompanied Prime Minister Hosokawa on his visit to Vancouver , reportedly met with a high-raking official of the U.S. Department of Defense and obtained information on progress in North Korea 's nuclear development .
However , in fact , at the meeting , in-depth discussions were held on such topics as progress in North Korea 's nuclear development , and its strike capability .
When the meeting is held , Russia will bring a more detailed , precise report on North Korea 's military power .
It is also true that after Prime Minister Hosokawa 's visit to the United States for the summit meeting , Japanese ministries and agencies concerned with North Korean issues have started seriously studying possible economic sanctions against North Korea .
I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects the future security of Japan .
The senior officer also said : `` Russia is not the only country which provides North Korea with nuclear resources .
You probably do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea .
It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been brought in to North Korea only recently .
If so , nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level radioactive material .
However , if it is so inclined , North Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how .
`` What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea already has at least one atomic bomb and 1 , 000-kilometer range missiles . ''
The top policymaker of Japan 's main opposition party on Wednesday -LSB- 16 February -RSB- blasted as insufficient North Korea 's acceptance of inspections of its seven nuclear facilities and urged it to allow checks on the two most controversial sites .
`` I 'm disgruntled at the fact that the latest agreement between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- has not cleared up all the ambiguities , '' said Ryutaro Hashimoto , chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 's Policy Affairs Research council .
Addressing a news conference at the Japan National Press Club , Hashimoto said , `` there are still some murky points , as North Korea has not agreed to accept inspection of its two nuclear waste reprocessing facilities . ''
The IAEA and the United States have said they are keen to check the discrepancies between the actual amount of plutonium North Korea has produced and a much smaller amount of plutonium the nation has admitted manufacturing in the past .
Hashimoto 's comment came a day after North Korea told the IAEA it will allow IAEA monitors to inspect the seven nuclear sites , while keeping out them out of the two critical facilities .
He urged the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to take a firmer stand in responding to a proposal -- now before the UN Security Council -- to slap trade sanctions on North Korea if it fails to allow full inspection of all the facilities the IAEA is demanding to see .
`` The LDP 's own study indicates that the Hosokawa administration has not compiled any crisis management program '' to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue , he said .
Hashimoto said the LDP `` will not consider exchanges `` between party officials and the North Korean Government following the 1993 fall from grace of former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru who had kept ties with the Pyongyang authorities .
`` Although it is true that Mr. Kanemaru held talks with the North Korean Government , he did so as a mere individual , '' he said .
He said the LDP had never sought to build ties with the North Korean leadership as a party policy .
Their talks with North Korean leader Kim Il -song later led to the start of diplomatic normalization talks between the two countries .
The normalization talks broke down after Pyongyang refused to comply with the IAEA 's demands to inspect its nuclear facilities .
North Korea has agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- to conduct inspection on all seven reported nuclear facilities , the IAEA announced Tuesday .
At a working-level contact in Vienna Tuesday , North Korea informed the IAEA that it will accept all IAEA conditions for inspection , the announcement said .
Meanwhile in New York , North Korea and the United States resumed their working-level meeting Tuesday to negotiate followup measures on IAEA inspection .
At the Vienna meeting , the IAEA told North Korea it plans to send a team of inspectors as soon as possible .
The IAEA said the purpose of the upcoming inspection is to see whether the nuclear materials in the seven reported facilities had been converted for other uses since February last year when the IAEA last conducted inspection .
The main point of the agreement was North Korea 's acceptance of all the conditions the IAEA had laid out for the forthcoming inspection , IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said .
Meyer also explained that the agreement does not mean that there was a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue .
The inspection team , comprising six to seven experts , is expected to stay in North Korea for two to three weeks , IAEA officials said .
Councilor Yun Ho -chin of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna said that the agreement was reached in order to maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards .
In another development , North Korea is reportedly sending a high-level delegation to the IAEA board meeting Feb. 21 .
The IAEA- North Korean agreement came after six rounds of talks since Pyongyang and Washington reached an accord in New York on Jan. 7 .
A seven -member inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to resume inspections of North Korea 's seven declared nuclear facilities after a lapse of more than a year , informed sources in Beijing said .
North Korea agreed to the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- on Friday in New York at a working-level meeting with U.S. Officials .
North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear sites in 1992 , but threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to allow checks of two undeclared facilities suspected of being related to a clandestine nuclear arms development program .
The inspections , however , will not include the two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear waste storage facilities that could reveal the nature of the North Korean nuclear program .
IAEA inspectors have said that to make the checks meaningful they would have to examine the nuclear fuel rods to determine if plutonium , which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic arsenal , had been extracted .
Meanwhile , Pyongyang rejected a South Korean request on Tuesday to reopen the inter- Korean dialogue , proposing instead to meet Thursday at the border truce village of Panmunjom .
In response to the delay , the South Korean Government held off its decision to cancel the `` Team Spirit `` U.S. - South Korea joint military exercises .
Reopening the inter- Korean dialogue and calling off the military exercises had been half of a four -item agreement reached February 25 in a working-level meeting in New York between U.S. and North Korean representatives .
The agreement had been reached to ensure IAEA inspectors access to the North Korean facilities .
Although Pyongyang had agreed with the IAEA on February 15 to permit the checks , it held back issuing the necessary visas to the inspection team and demanded that a date be set for a third round of high-level talks with the U.S. Following the meeting in New York , North Korean representatives said that the third round would open March 21 in Geneva , but Washington is insisting that Seoul - Pyongyang talks on the exchange of special envoys be initiated first .
North and South have agreed to make the Korean peninsula nuclear- free , but North Korea has insisted that the issue can only be resolved through a bilateral dialogue with Washington .
It says : `` The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LSB- DPRK -RSB- has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and the DPRK has test-fired medium-range ballistic missiles .
At that time , North Korea was engaged in developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with the direct assistance of the Soviet Union .
The following are questions and answers : -LSB- Unidentified officer -RSB- `` In my view , nuclear inspections are a ridiculous story .
-LSB- Kato -RSB- But , Russia is officially saying it is not supporting North Korean nuclear development .
-LSB- Kato -RSB- Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change its missile development plan ?
It may be safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more advanced missile development technology , including know-how of developing missiles with the sold fuel type method .
If what the senior officer said is true , not only Japan but also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of Kim Il -song .
In an interview with the Russian news agency , the North Korean director general of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry overseas affairs bureau , Choe Chong -sun , acknowledged that some plutonium was at the complex but did not elaborate on the total amount .
Choe is the first top North Korean official to admit to his country 's possession of plutonium .
As to cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog , Choe said North Korea has no specific expectations `` at present as well as in the past , '' disclosing that only 500,000 U.S. dollars was provided by the agency last year for agricultural and medical purposes .
Although the former Soviet Union provided key assistance in building the reactor , he continued , North Korea does not hold out much hope that its successor Russia will do the same .
He maintained that `` there is almost no cooperation with Russia presently in the nuclear field . ''
Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to separate the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later inspection have not been confirmed , sources said .
The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other way , they said .
Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods , it is difficult to say what can be done about the situation , they said , indicating that follow-up measures by the United States and South Korea depend largely on the North 's attitude .
Manpower in North Korea 's Nuclear Development Program : Its Personal Relationships , Training and Taboos
To Sang-nok , Han In -sok and other scientists who defected to the North against the `` National University Plan `` laid the foundations .
Theses written by 100 -odd North Korean scientists in the 1970 's are kept in the U.S. National Archives .
When did North Korea embark on its nuclear development program ?
These questions surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue have not been fully answered , although there has been a great deal of discussion dealing with hardware .
For this reporting , I interviewed nuclear scientists in the South , persons who had served in high positions in North Korea in the past , and correspondents who visited Pyongyang .
Among them were some who were deeply involved in the nuclear development effort in the Pak Chong-hui era .
North Korea first began exploring nuclear development possibilities in the mid-1950 's immediately after the end of the Korean War .
Kim Il -song , who had been unnerved by MacArthur 's atomic bomb threat , reorganized the Korean People 's Army -LSB- KPA -RSB- in 1954 right after the end of the war , establishing a `` Nuclear Weapons Defense Branch `` for the first time as part of the reorganization .
The next year , in 1955 , President Eisenhower went so far as to say that `` new-type nuclear weapons '' will be deployed to the U.S. Forces in Korea -LSB- USFK -RSB- , stirring North Korea .
Meanwhile , President Syngman Rhee , crying out for `` March to the North for Reunification , '' declared that `` if the North invades us , we will respond with a nuclear holocaust . ''
North Korea , confronted with the crisis , held a mammoth Pyongyang City Mass Rally on 5 August 1955 to condemn the United States .
According to Mr `` A , '' a former North Korean official who participated in that rally , `` the uneasy feelings the nuclear threat caused among the North Korean authorities and population then were almost a panic . ''
About that time , the former Soviet Union , then the leading power of the communist world , launched an all-out effort to develop a new-type , nuclear weapon that can match what the United States had .
Thus came the `` Agreement on the Organization of a Joint Nuclear Research Center `` signed in 1956 as part of Soviet nuclear strategy .
The agreement stated that 11 socialist countries -LRB- the Soviet Union , China , North Korea , Vietnam , Mongolia , Poland , East Germany , Romania , Hungary , Bulgaria , and Albania -RRB- will pool manpower and material resources for joint nuclear research and utilization to strengthen the nuclear capabilities of the socialist camp .
The joint research thus started was conducted at the renowned Dubna Nuclear Research Center in Moscow .
It was an old institute reorganized and rechristened `` Dubna Joint Nuclear Research Center , '' they say .
`` It was then that North Korea , in accordance with the agreement , began sending 20 to 30 nuclear physicists to Dubna every year , '' said Mr `` A. ``
Through all this , Pyongyang took interest in a nuclear development program early on .
Then came the 1962 `` Cuban crisis '' which led North Korea to distrust the Soviet nuclear umbrella .
North Korea was seized with apprehensions that with Khrushchev in power , the protection of the Soviet nuclear umbrella could be taken away from it in the event of a similar U.S. threat .
It was precisely in December that year at the Fifth Plenum of the Fourth Workers Party of Korea -LSB- WPK -RSB- Central Committee that North Korea put forth the Four Military Lines calling for self-reliant defenses .
The U.S. nuclear threat increased its pressure on North Korea in the early 1970 's .
Especially , at the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 , the United States deployed additional tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea against a possible invasion by the North , even pronouncing that `` if the North should invade the South , we will crush it with our tactical nuclear weapons . ''
Newspapers and broadcasts unhesitatingly reported on the nuclear arming of the USFK .
`` At the time , North Korea was engrossed in the task of determining the strength of tactical nuclear weapons deployed to the USFK .
Materials were gathered from South Korean newspapers , broadcasts , and magazines and from authoritative Japanese and U.S. newspapers for analytical purposes .
Through this work , it determined that the number of tactical nuclear weapons as referred to in a ` Memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , ' was 900 to 1,000 , '' said Mr. `` A. ``
Against these historical backdrops , Kim Il -song and Kim Chong-il began saying in the mid-1970 's that `` the key of modern warfare is nuclear strategy .
The nuclear weapon can be a political and military threat . ''
In other words , Pyongyang had recognized its military strategic need for nuclear weapons .
Further , it began viewing nuclear weapons in light of the strategy for survival .
It was then that the North Korean leadership began thinking -- vaguely though -- that it should come to have nuclear weapons .
`` In North Korea 's case , military science -- nuclear science in particular -- must have become an ambitious Big Science program for it , '' says Dr Yun Se -won , 72 , a South Korean nuclear science pioneer of the Syngman Rhee era .
According to scientists who were deeply involved in nuclear development in the Pak Chong-hui era , North Korean scientists who worked for the nuclear development program , Pyongyang 's Big Science program , can be divided into the first , second , and third generations -- those who defected to the North around the time of the Korean War forming the first , their children who defected to the North with them and who later studied in the Soviet Union making up the second , and those who were educated in North Korea , then studied in the Soviet Union and who are currently working in the nuclear development program representing the third generation .
The father and son are said to have defected to the North together .
Regarding his work in North Korea , Mr. `` B , '' another former North Korean official , said as follows : `` I understand that while serving as the head of the chair of physics in Kim Il -song University , Prof. To was devoted to radioisotope research .
Without Soviet aid , he was laying the foundations of nuclear energy research almost single-handedly .
In other words , To Sang-nok is the father of nuclear research in North Korea . ''
To Sang -nok became an Academician , the highest position for a scientist in North Korea , and was awarded the titles of Labor Hero and People 's Scientist .
Meanwhile , some observers view Dr Yi Sung -ki as having made greater contributions to the North Korea nuclear development program .
They are mostly veteran scientists who know both To Sang-nok and Yi Sung -ki well or those who took part in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort .
He was the second SNU president when he defected to the North immediately before the Korean War .
Commenting on his role in the nuclear development program , Dr Yi Pyong- ho , 70 , professor emeritus of the KAIST nuclear engineering department , said as follows : `` Although it is not very likely that he participated directly in the nuclear development program , there is no question that he must have performed the role of organizing the research team for it .
He is the top leader of North Korean scientists .
Moreover , considering the fact that the process of extracting plutonium for atomic bomb materials is fundamentally a process of chemical engineering , and that Kyoto U. is known for being most advanced in nuclear physical chemistry , it would not be strange if he took part in the nuclear development program .
`` He was not , '' countered Mr. `` B , '' the former North Korean official who testified earlier about To Sang-no .
With regard to Yi Sung-ki 's work in North Korea , the latter said as follows : `` It is true that of all the scientists in North Korea , Yi Sung -ki was trusted most , but he was a chemical engineer known for his vinalon research , not a nuclear scientist .
He became the director of the Research Institute of Chemical Technology right after his defection to the North , but soon began devoting himself to vinalon research while leaving institute business to Yo Kyong -ku , his junior partner .
It should be noted , however , that while making all-out efforts for nuclear development , North Korea did even more to develop chemical weapons .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- Meanwhile , influenced by Dr. Yi Sung -ki , many professors and students of the SNU engineering school 's chemical engineering branch defected to the North .
Among those professors were Yo Kyong -ku , who went over to the North even before Yi , and Ma Hyong-ok , Yi Se-hun , Kim Tae-yol , Yi Chang -chik , and Sin Hyon -sok .
Also , it is said that it was about that time when Kwon Tae-mun , Kim Pyong -chun , and Ok Chi-hun , who were all classmates of Ma Kyong -sok , 73 , honorary president of the South Korea Engineers Club , and second -batch graduates of the chemical engineering branch , defected to the North .
It is difficult to rule out the possibility of those who had majored in chemical engineering , a course with possible links to nuclear reprocessing , having performed a role in the nuclear development program .
He was also told , Ma said , that Yi Chae-op , a graduate of the Kyoto U. chemical engineering course who defected to the North before Liberation , and Chang Chil-pyo , his pupil who went to the North with him , had married Yi Sung-ki 's daughters .
Besides Dr. Yi Sung -ki and Prof. To Sang-nok , another person who seemed to have played a leading role in the nuclear development program is Prof. Han In -sok .
A graduate of the physics course of Japan 's Tohoku University , he studied in Germany for a while , then served as physics professor at Kyongsong U. It is known that soon after that , he , as one of the opponents to the `` National University Plan , '' briefly moved to Yonsei University before defecting to the North .
In the North , however , it seems that he stood very much in the spotlight .
He began giving North Korean leaders , including party cadres , lectures on the importance of nuclear energy and the need for nuclear development , in the late 1950 's .
In the early 1960 's , he put out many theses concerning nuclear development .
Han In-sok , along with To Sang-nok , can be called the founder of North Korea 's nuclear physics . ''
According to a nuclear engineer who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort , `` when Dr Yi Sung -ki was in charge of organizing the nuclear development team , Chong Kun must have acted as the top working aide for him .
It is said that he left for Moscow to study after his defection to the North .
He studied nuclear physics in Moscow , specializing in reactor physics , a field directly linked with the nuclear development program .
`` When I was involved in a leftist movement , '' Cho said , `` I first thought that he belonged to the South Korean Labor Party , but later learned that he had belonged to the North Korean Workers Party from the beginning . ''
In addition to the above-listed , scientists like Yo Kyong -ku , Chon Pyong-su , Kim Yong-ho and Yo Chol -ki are thought , in the views of atomic energy-related scholars , to have participated in the nuclear development program one way or another , for their academic levels .
Yo Kyong -ku , nephew of Yo Un-hyong , who majored in applied chemistry in Japan 's Waseda University , was assistant professor of chemical engineering at Kyongsong U. when he made his rather early defection to the North .
About that time , after learning that Dr. Yi Sung -ki was troubled by the `` National University Plan , '' he is said to have visited Yi to suggest that he go over to the North .
In North Korea , Yo Kyong -ku rose to Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences .
In North Korea , he briefly departed from scientific research and joined a political school , even serving as the party 's top responsible officer at KISU .
Among theses he wrote in the 1960 's were `` On Nuclear Interaction in Nuclear Fluid by Particles with Energy , '' `` On Raising Precision in Measurement of Each Distribution , '' and `` On Each Distribution of Secondary Particles in Nuclear Interaction with Heavy Nucleuses in Nuclear Fluid . ''
Kim Yong-ho , who majored in quantum chemistry at Japan 's Kyoto U. , was a chemistry professor at Kyongsong U. when he defected to the North .
Quantum chemistry is said to have connections with nuclear reprocessing facilities .
Yo Chol-ki , one of the second -batch graduates of the SNU physics course , was assistant professor of the university when he defected to the North .
He attended a 1990 World Conference of Korean Physicists held at Yanbian University in China as chairman of the North Korean Physical Society , and accompanied by four persons .
He had specialized in hydromechanics , then in particle physics , and the latest I had heard was that he was studying nuclear physics .
Besides Yo Chol -ki , North Korean physicists Cho Pyong -nae and Kim Yong-il , both specializing in statistical mechanical physics , attended the conference .
Scientists referred to in the above were mostly Kyongsong U. professors in physics or chemical engineering when they defected to the North .
In the views of atomic energy-related scholars , they must have laid North Korea 's scientific foundations , setting the direction of its nuclear development program .
These people went straight to North Korea while they were overseas for study purposes .
In the views of atomic energy scientists in the South , it is possible that they also participated in North Korea 's Big Science project , the nuclear development program .
Forming another group are second-generation scientists who were trained by the above-listed seniors and who could have performed the central role in the nuclear development program .
Choe Hak-kun , a native of Hamgyong Province , is a nuclear expert who went to Moscow University from KISU , then to the Dubna NRC .
He also served as counselor in Vienna for 4 years from 1975 , when North Korea joined the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- .
North Korean officials in Vienna usually moved around in a pair ; on rare occasions when Choe met with Dr. Yi by himself , he always was inquisitive about the state of atomic energy in South Korea , said Dr. Yi .
Dr. Yi also noted that `` at any rate , the massive data thus gathered at the time must have been used for the nuclear development program . ''
Meanwhile , since North Korea 's entry into the IAEA , Choe Hak-kun intensified his demand for the `` denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . ''
Yun Ho -chin , resident officer in Vienna , was responsible for administrative affairs concerning the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -LSB- NPT -RSB- and the inspection issue .
A graduate of the KISU physics department , he also had extensive knowledge about nuclear power .
He is a specialist who is , in effect , in charge of external affairs concerning the North Korean nuclear issue .
Kye Yong-sun , a KISU gradate , who also studied in the Dubna NRC , is a key figure in North Korea 's nuclear power plant construction .
It was he who first suggested that `` we build nuclear power plants for ourselves '' in early 1970 , they say .
Kye Hyong -sun , former minister of machine-building industry , regarded as the godfather of North Korea 's munitions industry , is his elder brother , they say .
Under these second-generation scientists , there are third-generation specialists who returned from the former Soviet Union and are currently active on the first line of the nuclear development program .
Fortunately , Mr `` B , '' the former high official in North Korea , knew one of them -- Yi Yun- song , alias Yi Yun-su .
The people mentioned above are part of the North Korean brains in the nuclear development program as we came to know about from information provided by atomic energy scientists and intelligence agencies in our country and by people who formerly served in high posts in North Korea .
It is by using our judgement on the basis of theses written by North Korean scientists .
Agencies in the South reportedly used the same method for some time to measure levels of the North Korean nuclear development program .
The Korean division of the National Archives of the U.S. Congress is known to be the only place in the West that provides access to theses by North Korean scientists .
Entering the 1970 's , North Korea apparently tightened control over the handling of theses as it embarked on its nuclear development program .
Most of the theses were printed in KWAHAGWON TONGBO -LSB- ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT -RSB- , which is a highest-level journal published in North Korea .
Considering the fact that they were by North Korean scientists in the period through the early 1970 's , and that the nuclear development program has been Pyongyang 's Big Science undertaking , it can be said that a considerably large number of the authors probably participated in the nuclear development program .
In addition , there were scientists brought in from overseas , mostly Korean residents in foreign countries .
Explaining , Mr. `` B '' said : `` I understand that quite a few overseas Korean nuclear scientists entered North Korea .
Of those from Japan , some stayed on in North Korea taking part in the development program while others shuttled between the two countries .
The Korean Scientists and Engineers Association in Japan -LRB- Kwahyop -RRB- served as the channel .
Kwahyop 's slogan was `` Promote Scientific Research and Technological Development of Korean Scientists in Japan and Contribute to North Korea 's Construction . ''
Among them are scientists working in nuclear fusion , control engineering and accelerator fields or even taking part in nuclear technology development programs .
Dr. Kyong Won - ha is one of them whose name is frequently mentioned in conversations concerning Korean scientists who went to North Korea from Japan .
He is known to have participated in the atomic bomb building at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico , then served as professor at Canada 's McGill University before moving to North Korea in about 1974 .
But a check with atomic energy-related scientists and people who formerly serviced in high posts in North Korea revealed that none of them had any knowledge about him .
At a time when information is as scarce as it is , the foregoing list could represent a small , first step in our attempt to get a more comprehensive picture of human relationships in the North Korean nuclear development program .
North Korea 's training system for nuclear-related talents also deserves careful attention .
The first nuclear physics course was established in 1949 before the Korean War .
`` That year , North Korea 's first nuclear physics course was created within the KISU physics school and 30 students were selected for it , '' said Mr `` B. ``
Needless to say , they were not all nuclear physics students .
Suppose 30 students left for Moscow or St. Petersburg in any given year , three to four of them were nuclear physics students .
The KISU nuclear physics course was closed temporarily during the war but reopened later .
After that , in about 1957 , a nuclear engineering department , made up by three courses , was created in Kim Chaek Institute of Technology -LSB- KCIT -RSB- .
Further , in 1963 , a nuclear physics course was opened in Pyongsong Institute of Science in South Pyongan Province , a college under the control of the Academy of Sciences , accepting 50 students .
Pyongsong is a North Korean science town similar to Taedok Science Town in the South , and its Institute of Science is an equivalent of our Institute of Science and Technology .
While they are all for the study of nuclear physics , KISU is dedicated to both theoretical and technological researches , KCIT trains technical personnel and Pyongsong trains scientists , research officers and professors primarily in fundamental theoretical fields .
Besides , a nuclear engineering department was created in the National Defense College in Hyesan in about 1963 , primarily for the training of specialists in munitions and weaponry .
Basically through these four institutes , North Korea has systematically trained its personnel since the 1950 's .
The length of their nuclear physics courses is 7 years , they say , and they accept only bright students .
Children of state cadres who are bright enough are required to take the nuclear physics course mandatorily even if it is against their wish .
Since that time , if a student would avoid applying for the nuclear physics course , he or she would be sent to the countryside or otherwise called to task for it . ''
Attached to these institutes are , respectively , `` the KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute , '' `` the KCIT Nuclear Physics Research Institute , '' and `` the Nuclear Physics Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences . ''
The KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute has a long history of research in radioactive isotope .
They include the `` Atomic Energy Research Institute , '' `` Radioactivity Prevention Research Institute , '' and `` Nuclear Power Generating Research Institute . ''
North Korea began its expansion in earnest in 1962 after the fifth plenum of the fourth party Central Committee .
Beginning in the 1960 's , North Korean institutes turned out nuclear scientists in large numbers who were trained by themselves through those 7-year courses .
There they , along with scientists from other socialist nations , jointly participated in the Soviet nuclear development program .
So , Soviet scientists , knowing about their abilities more than anyone else , would never underestimate the levels of North Korean students , it is said .
At times , students were deported back home from Dubna because of their persistent attempt to spy on advanced Soviet nuclear technology .
North Korean students were also sent to the Kurchatov NRC , the Kiev NRC and the Ioffe NRC .
While Dubna was for basic research in nuclear physics , Kurchatov was known as a laboratory for experimenting and building nuclear bombs .
Dr. Yi Pyong -hwi happened to be allowed to visit the Kurchatov Nuclear Physics Research Center , a secret facility , for 1 week in 1992 .
Named after Dr. Kurchatov , who led the team that built and tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949 , the center stands about 20 kilometers from downtown Moscow .
Nuclear fusion , remote control and radioactivity lab facilities appeared to be incomparably more sophisticated and advanced than those at the Argonne National Laboratory where the Manhattan Project was conducted .
Consequently , the United States is reportedly working on economic aid for improvement in the treatment of Russian nuclear scientists so as to prevent their exodus from the country .
`` It is quite possible , '' Dr. Yi speculated , `` that quite a few of those Russian nuclear scientists who had been to North Korea in the past , returned there in 1989 or 1990 during the disintegration of the Soviet Union and just stayed on there . ''
North Korea also sent scientists to China , which successfully conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964 , although fewer in numbers than those sent to the Soviet Union .
For exchanges with Chinese nuclear physicists , Pyongyang sent its specialists to Xiangshan Zhao Dai Suo in Beijing where those Chinese frequently get together .
Thus trained through various routes , the number of North Korean nuclear experts and technical personnel is now estimated at approximately more than 5,000 , including 200 trained at Dubna .
North Korea produced on its own a short-range rocket missile using nuclear energy in the late 1960 's .
Pyongyang 's nuclear policy came to the fore in March 1974 when Kim Il -song told a National Industrial Workers Meeting that `` we must build nuclear power plants on our own . ''
In addition to an army of nuclear talents thus trained , North Korea has uranium ore deposits scattered all over the country , a factor that made possible the nuclear development on its own .
Other uranium mines include one at Unggi , North Hamgyong Province , and the Kujang Mine in Mt .
Although North Korea had to send ores to the Soviet Union for processing before the 1960 's , it later built its own smelting plants near mines for independent processing .
It reportedly was the unquestioned top candidate when authorities were looking for a site for the nuclear development complex .
Guard posts were erected around the complex , which was then put off limits to unauthorized persons .
Except for workers there and Kim Il -song , Kim Chong-il , and the chief of the general staff of the KPA , no one is allowed to enter the complex without authorization , including high-ranking cadres and politburo members .
Officials from the complex in another car meet them there .
Researchers are usually not authorized to leave the complex .
Telephones and mail to and from the complex are out of question .
On the other hand , the complex has every facility needed for the daily life of people there , they say .
When the need arises for building facilities inside the complex , a special team of the 105th construction unit under the Ministry of Public Security is assigned to it .
So , there is absolutely no way for outside people to know what is going on inside the complex .
`` Considering the fact that major North Korean facilities have gone underground , facilities that have been put to the international inspections are only those that had been made public .
Nuclear physics research institutes attached to universities in general are also under strict security .
Mr. `` A `` said he would like to point out a misconception which he comes across so frequently in discussions about the North Korean nuclear issue .
It is that because of the current economic crisis , Pyongyang would be unable to continue the enormously expensive nuclear development program .
It is indeed a capitalist perception , he went on , but the fact is that in North Korea , they can carry out any project only by paying the personnel expenses , and if that should become difficult , even by just giving workers enough to eat .
Materials needed for the nuclear development program are mostly available domestically .
Even for them , North Korea could solve the payment problem by , extremely speaking , mobilizing military personnel for free labor at gold mines and refining facilities and handing over nuggets to the Soviets , Mr. `` A `` said , adding that although digging a tunnel , for instance , costs dearly in the South , it can be done virtually free in North Korea by mobilizing people 's labor .
It 's not within the authority of the IAEA to inspect military sites , '' said Maj. Gen. Kim Yong -chol of the North Korean People 's Army in an interview with America 's Cable News Network -LRB- CNN -RRB- .
CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican president who was visiting Pyongyang , presumably for North Korean President Kim Il -song 's 82nd birthday last Friday .
`` Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament between the two sides , '' Kim said .
`` The authority the IAEA was given is to inspect peaceful nuclear facilities . ''
Asked if North Korea cooperates militarily with countries like Iran , Syria or Libya , Kim said , `` that is a question which is directly related to the distortions and the bad rumors about our country which are all fabricated , made up , by the West . ''
North Korea , as an independent state , has a right to maintain multilateral relations including military cooperation with other countries .
The International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- has asked North Korean experts to visit Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor , the Agency announced Wednesday -LSB- 11 May -RSB- .
In addition , Agency inspectors would visit North Korea `` in the next few days `` if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon reactor was postponed , the IAEA said in a statement .
U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons .
IAEA Director General Hans Blix proposed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Young-Nam in a telex message that North Korea send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss these measures and the timetable for replacement of the rods , the statement said .
The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign minister 's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of monitors to witness the fuel replacement .
The Blix message was made public in Seoul following unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date .
The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a radiochemical laboratory , from which IAEA inspectors were barred by North Koreans last March , and check surveillance equipments at various nuclear facilities .
In Vienna , IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors could leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response from Pyongyang was positive .
In an interview with the paper , Director-General Hans Blix , who is now staying in Japan , said that he could not know when the facility would be completed , but when it is built , North Korea 's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used for a nuclear weapons program -- would double .
Robert Gallucci , assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs , says the United States hopes to resume working-level contacts with North Korea in New York this week .
`` We hope that this week we 'll be able to get back to North Korea -- almost certainly using the New York channel ...
`` We have consulted our allies , particularly South Korea , that we 'll be able to go back to North Korea with a proposal , '' he said .
One of these elements , of course , requires that North Korea maintain the continuity of safeguards , Gallucci said .
Reiterating that the United States prefers a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , Gallucci noted that the `` Team Spirit `` military exercise was suspended as `` envisioned '' in the Feb. 25 agreement between the United States and North Korea .
`` Inter - Korean dialogue could also be an element , '' he said .
`` Advancing inter - Korean dialogue in some modality would also figure in such an arrangement . ''
Gallucci said the United States and its allies were not aiming to bring the North Korean nuclear issue back to the UN Security Council .
`` It will not be sufficent for the IAEA inspectors to be in North Korea while this is happening .
In any event , Gallucci said the United States would like to see North Korea 's nuclear program essentially frozen while `` we are engaged in these discussions . ''
He added , however , this was not a precondition for U.S. - North Korean talks .
Asked about the impression he had received from Chinese leaders in Beijing on the North Korean problem , Gallucci said , `` they do not believe that the best route to a settlement of this issue is through UN Security Council sanctions . ''
NORTH KOREA yesterday raised fears of an international confrontation over its suspected nuclear weapons programme by declaring that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
North Korea would be the first country to scrap membership of the treaty , which seeks to limit the spread of nuclear technology .
Mr Warren Christopher , the US secretary of state , threatened North Korea yesterday with possible international sanctions .
Asked if the US would push for United Nations sanctions against North Korea , he said : 'Certainly the North Korean situation is a serious one today and if they continue on the path that they are on I think that that will have to be considered . '
Ms Madeleine Albright , US ambassador to the United Nations , said : 'We call upon North Korea to withdraw its declaration immediately . '
The decision would halt inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency , which has carried out six inspections of North Korean facilities since Pyongyang permitted them last year .
It suspects the sites are being used to store nuclear waste for re-processing of plutonium .
However , Pyongyang responded that this was not possible at present because of the annual US / South Korean 'Team Spirit ' military exercises , now under way .
North Korea insists that the two sites are non-nuclear military installations of no concern to IAEA inspectors .
In Seoul , where the cabinet met in emergency session , the South Korean foreign ministry said : 'The North 's professed reasons for pulling out of the treaty convince no one .
This only heightens the suspicion that it is developing nuclear arms . '
The move threatened to undo recent progress in developing inter- Korean relations .
China , a permanent member of the Security Council and one of North Korea 's few remaining allies , issued a mild rebuke to North Korea .
SOUTH KOREA yesterday indicated that it would adopt a tougher attitude on the North Korean nuclear issue after Pyongyang rejected a proposal by Seoul to resume talks on mutual nuclear inspections .
'We gave everything we could give at the last round of North Korea - US high-level talks .
Now it 's time to show Pyongyang what sticks are in store , ' said Mr Han Sung -joo , the South Korean foreign minister .
During its discussions with the US last month , North Korea was offered improved relations with Washington and the supply of safer light-water reactors to replace its graphite-moderated ones if it accepted full nuclear inspections by South Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- .
The IAEA wants to examine sites to determine if North Korea is reprocessing more plutonium than it has disclosed , for possible use in developing nuclear weapons .
North Korea said on Monday that it rejected holding talks with the South through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission and instead insisted that the dispute about Pyongyang 's nuclear programme be linked to a summit meeting between the presidents of the two Koreas .
Seoul refuses the Pyongyang demand for a summit , calling it 'premature ' until the nuclear dispute is resolved .
Both the US and South Korea have suggested that they may ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea by the end of September unless Pyongyang shows results in talks with the IAEA and South Korea on the nuclear issue .
But the IAEA is still barred from two nuclear waste sites .
The IAEA demand to view these sites triggered North Korea 's announcement last March that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , although it later suspended the threatened action after holding talks with the US .
Mr Clinton 's assurances followed defiant statements from Pyongyang claiming that US demands for further inspections of nuclear sites were 'perfidious acts .
creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula , which may bring the Korean nation back to the phase of confrontation and war ' .
In response to the mounting tension with North Korea , Mr Clinton said : 'We have agreed that it is in our national interests and the interest of the people of South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to proceed with the Patriot deployment .
In a letter to President Kim Young-sam , Mr Clinton also said that the US would defend South Korea if it is attacked by the North .
Pyongyang yesterday maintained its defiant stance against concerted international pressure to open its nuclear sites to full inspections .
North Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if the US resumes its annual military exercise in South Korea and if the International Atomic Energy Agency decides that North Korea has not complied with its nuclear obligations .
The UN Security Council may then consider economic sanctions on North Korea .
After belligerent statements at the weekend , the North yesterday accused South Korea of 'driving the North-South relationship into a situation of confrontation and war ' , after the collapse of inter- Korean talks on the proposed exchange of presidential envoys .
Seoul also resumed preparations for the Team Spirit military exercise , although a decision on its timing has been delayed until President Kim Young-sam discusses the situation on the Korean peninsula with Chinese and Japanese leaders later this week .
Mr Warren Christopher , US secretary of state , said US policy would take account of all the risks , but stressed that some form of international action was necessary to combat nuclear proliferation .

A staff member recently fired by Councilman Bruce Henderson accused Henderson 's top aide Tuesday of engaging in political campaigning on city time , in violation of a City Charter prohibition against such activity by city employees during working hours .
Henderson , whose enmity for Wolfsheimer is well known , has publicly endorsed Trettin .
Ybarra said she had no knowledge of any impropriety by Henderson .
He said his only politics-related discussions in City Hall concerned scheduling appearances for Henderson .
`` I have n't ever been in Bruce Henderson 's office . ''
Ybarra , a single mother with a 3-year-old son , has been employed primarily to answer telephones and open mail since Henderson became a councilman in December , 1987 .
She offered as proof of her allegations against Sills a letter written by Orr and received in Henderson 's office Thursday .
The letter , dated Sept. 29 , carries Henderson 's name and asks recipients for contributions to Trettin 's campaign .
Sills said he can not be held responsible for receiving the letter in Henderson 's council office and said he admonished Orr to send political material to Sills ' home .
Orr , who described the letter as `` not one of my brighter '' actions , said the letter went out to Henderson 's political contributors this weekend .
But she said that Sills ' `` head started clicking and maybe -LRB- he thought -RRB- 'she knows too much , and we ought to get rid of her , ' `` Ybarra said .
Sills and the two political consultants identified by Ybarra -- Jean Andrews and Jack Orr -- denied Ybarra 's charges .
Cristie McGuire , who oversees election matters , said she could not comment on Ybarra 's claims without more specific information .
Ybarra 's accusations came against a backdrop of personal and job-related strife with Sills .
Ybarra acknowledges that she has had battles with Sills over his treatment of her in the council office .

Final approval by President Donald Kennedy is expected later this year .
Kennedy said Monday that he hoped Raisian 's appointment , effective immediately , will improve `` the relationship between Hoover and the rest of Stanford University . ''
Campbell fought with Kennedy over the terms and timing of his retirement and argued with liberal critics .
The students , who were arrested after invading university President Donald Kennedy 's office in May , also were ordered by a Santa Clara County judge to perform 40 hours of community service each .
Horton said that Hoover House , the residence of university President Donald Kennedy , is owned by the school and used regularly for campus activities .
Stanford University officials proposed to ban alcohol consumption at all Stanford athletic events .
Stanford has been the only school in the Pacific-10 athletic conference to allow spectators to bring alcohol inside a stadium .
Three years ago , Stanford banned hard liquor at games and limited each person over 21 to carrying in one six -pack of beer .
William Chace , president of Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn. , sent students a letter about racial relations on campus and the film `` Mississippi Burning '' about the 1964 murders of civil rights activists .
The posters , which bore telephone numbers for reporting incidents , were a way for the university to acknowledge that some people thought racism was a problem on campus , said Patricia Peterson , assistant vice president for campus life .
`` Right now -LRB- administrators -RRB- are doing surface changes , '' said Yvette Dudley , president of the NAACP chapter at Penn State .
John Raisian , acting director of the politically influential Hoover Institution think tank at Stanford University since last September , has been given the job permanently , officials announced Monday .
Several sources at Stanford said the first choice to succeed Campbell was Michael Boskin , the Stanford economics professor who is chairman of President Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers .
Although Campbell praised Raisian 's appointment , John F. Manley , a Stanford political science professor and critic of Hoover , said : `` A new director does n't change the old problem .
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not make a previously announced visit to the Hoover Institution during his trip to Stanford University next week .
Soviet officials decided that Gorbachev 's schedule during his June 3 and 4 visit to the Bay Area `` was just too tight , '' Bob Freelen , Stanford vice president for public affairs , said Monday .
On the high-society block where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife , Raisa , will sleep tonight , the neighbors and their help know all about the demands of security .
At Stanford University , where Gorbachev will speak Monday , students are taking the metal detectors and other precautions in stride , so anxious are they to get a glimpse of the Soviet leader and his wife .
In addition to Gorbachev , the Secret Service must protect former President Ronald Reagan , for instance , who will have breakfast with the Soviet leader at the consul general 's home , and South Korean President Roh Tae Woo , who is scheduled to meet Gorbachev on Monday .
`` Nobody identifies themselves as KGB , '' said Robert Freelen , Stanford 's vice president for public affairs .
The Secret Service and KGB will be assisted by agencies ranging from the FBI to the California Highway Patrol as well as by police in San Francisco , Palo Alto and Stanford , and security officers at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco .
After breakfast with the Reagans , the Gorbachevs will head to Stanford , 35 miles south .
At Stanford , officials issued tickets Friday to several thousand students and staff members to see Gorbachev arrive in the quadrangle Monday morning .
The 1,700 people who will attend Gorbachev 's speech at Stanford 's Memorial Auditorium will have to pass through metal detectors .
CHP officers will ensure that the 30 - car motorcade travels Bay Area freeways swiftly between San Francisco , Stanford and San Francisco airport .
Here is Monday 's itinerary for the visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife , Raisa , to San Francisco and Stanford University .

It appointed a commission to bargain with competing hospitals , and Stanford University Hospital was among those awarded contracts .
At Stanford Hospital the number of Medi-Cal patients has been increasing 12 % annually since 1988 , out of proportion to the number of fully paying patients .
More than one-quarter of the indigent patients admitted to Stanford come from outside Santa Clara County and neighboring San Mateo County .
Forty-eight students who took over the president 's office at Stanford University to advocate more minority faculty members and administrators pleaded no contest to trespassing charges and were sentenced to six months ' probation .
Stanford University has charged taxpayers $ 2,500 to refurbish a grand piano , $ 3,000 for a cedar -lined closet and $ 2,000 a month for flower arrangements at the official residence of the university 's president , according to congressional investigators .
The figures were discovered after federal auditors questioned millions of dollars that Stanford had billed the government for government-backed research in recent years .
The Office of Naval Research , which monitors payments to Stanford for all government research , said Thursday that a five -person team will be sent to Palo Alto to investigate allegations concerning the billing practices .
Last week , faced with questions from the congressional investigators , Stanford disclosed that the university had repaid $ 184,286 that it had erroneously charged the government for depreciation on a 72-foot yacht , complete with Jacuzzi , as well as on other equipment .
Congressional investigators now are sifting through thousands of vouchers at the university in preparation for a hearing early next year on the manner in which Stanford has billed the government for overhead costs associated with government research .
`` We have recently discovered a number of charges that have been absorbed by the government that neither I nor the taxpayers financing these costs would consider reasonable or proper , '' Rep. John D. Dingell -LRB- D - Mich. -RRB- said in a letter asking federal auditors to step up their examination of research overhead costs at Stanford .
He indicated that similar questions may exist at other universities , and investigators said that Stanford is only the first of several schools that will come under scrutiny .
Larry Horton , Stanford 's associate vice president for public affairs , said that the university has followed proper guidelines in billing the government and provided auditors with what it believes are justifications for the figures challenged in audits .
The investigation was triggered by unrest among the Stanford faculty over the high overhead rate that the university charges the government for research and complaints from a government auditor .
Stanford charges the government 74 cents for every dollar the government spends on research at the school to cover those indirect costs , one of the highest rates in the nation .
That means that the government must pay Stanford $ 1.74 million for a $ 1-million research project .
In fiscal 1989 , Stanford was paid $ 241 million for government research , including overhead .
Investigators for Dingell and the General Accounting Office , an investigative arm of Congress , said they suspect that Stanford and other universities shift as much of their operating burden as possible to the government .
For 1991 , Stanford is seeking a rate of 78 % .
A decrease in the rate would cost Stanford millions of dollars .
Frank Riddle , Stanford 's comptroller , said auditors have received additional documentation and he expects the full rate request to be approved .
For instance , the auditors have questioned $ 2.3 million in such costs that Stanford says should be paid by the government because it represented space and material used for research .

Morgan was runner-up in a recent British television vote for the most boring man in Britain -LRB- the winner collected brown paper bags -RRB- .
Morgan spotted one suspended over a naked bulb outside a brothel in Amsterdam .
Morgan has done well from the cones .
But Morgan sells cones to police forces and traffic authorities as far away as Saudi Arabia and China , as well as large and engineering companies across the UK .
'We get orders from all over the world , ' says Morgan .
Morgan 's company makes everything from the diminutive 13-inch traffic cone to the giant Highwayman .
Personalised wedding cones decorated with lace and frills are available to order and Morgan sells about 50 special black funeral cones a week .
Is Morgan proud of his job ?
In the interests of safety an ordinary motorway contra -flow requires about 10,000 road cones .
'For me road cones hold an extraordinary fascination , and I can spot a different design at 100 yards , ' he says .
Britain , with the best road safety record in the world , has persuaded other countries to invest in cones and 20 per cent of their sales are overseas , mostly to mainland Europe .
He has even diversified into road signs , barrier systems , flashing lamps and paint for marking out white and yellow lines .
In Britain , the 365 -page Traffic Sign Regulation and General Directions booklet gives precise dimensions and colours of cones , and the layout needed for certain types of traffic control .
'Well it 's not something I admit to socially , but it 's quite satisfying knowing my product sees people through road works safely . '
What if there is a decline in road building ?

Washington state 's software industry is now a thriving Dollars 3bn -a-year business and the computer software industry is the fastest growing segment of the state 's economy .
In 1980 , 14 software companies employed 566 people in the state , according to the Washington state department of trade and economic development .
By 1990 , there were more than 500 software companies in Washington employing 9,600 people and the numbers have continued to rise .
Washington and California have strong reputations for good 'quality of life ' ; a significant draw for young talented people .
The University of Washington , in Seattle , has close links with local software companies , but it can provide only a fraction of the graduates that the industry needs .
The software industry 's growth has outstripped the supply of qualified graduates from Washington state 's universities and colleges , according to the Washington Software Association , an industry group representing software developers in the state , and vocational schools .
To do this , we must have a trained , skilled workforce , and there is no better way to find that workforce than by growing it at home , through Washington state 's educational system , ' says Paul Brainerd , president of Aldus , a leader in the field of desktop publishing software based near Seattle , and chairman of the Washington industry group 's education committee .
WSA aims to encourage Washington high school students to consider a career in the software industry and is also sponsoring scholarships at Washington University .
Yet for Microsoft , the flagship of Washington 's software industry , attracting talent is hardly a problem .
Moreover , 64 per cent of Microsoft 's recruits last year came from the state of Washington , suggesting that the leading software company gets the lion 's share of new graduates in the state with computer science and related disciplines .
Indeed , Microsoft is so much bigger than any other software company in Washington that its fortunes drive the growth trend in the state 's software industry .
But the joke also makes a serious point : the growth and immigration of the past decade have created substantial developmental problems for Seattle and the surrounding four -county Puget Sound region , which together account for half Washington state 's economic output .
'It 's a very delicate act , but it has to be done because the quality of life is partly what brings people here , ' says Mr Paul Sommers , research director at the University of Washington 's Northwest Policy Center .
Alarmed by the urban sprawl created in the late 1980s , the Washington state legislature passed a growth management act in 1990 which requires all cities and counties to draw up development plans which define urban boundaries and create a coherent , consistent development plan .
It is bounded on two sides by water - Puget Sound to the west and Lake Washington to the east - and on three sides by mountains .
Microsoft and Tele-Communications -LRB- TCI -RRB- have agreed to test interactive cable television technology jointly in Seattle , Washington .
From these the company chose about 4,000 new employees , bringing its world-wide workforce to about 11,000 including about 4,400 at its Redmond headquarters in an 'East Side ' suburb of Seattle .
Boeing , which has its headquarters just south of Seattle and is by far the region 's largest employer , seems set to enjoy strong long-term growth .
Throughout its history Seattle has looked to Asia for trade and cultural ties and has developed unusually strong links with Japan - underlined recently when a consortium led by Nintendo , the Japanese games company with its US headquarters in Seattle , made a takeover bid for the city 's baseball team .
`` Apple used to be the computer for everybody , and then it became a machine for the corporate market , '' said Tim Bajarin , executive vice president of Creative Strategies , a personal computer research firm .
A strategy put in place by Sculley in 1985 to sell the Macintosh to corporate America was more successful than many expected , but the Apple model still claims only about 8 % of the market .

But parents , staff physicians , nutritionists and health groups nationwide question whether a fast-food restaurant -- which offers foods high in calories and cholesterol along with salads and bran muffins -- is appropriate in a hospital for children .
A regular bag of french fries adds 220 calories and a chocolate milkshake racks up 388 calories -- bringing the total meal to 1,170 calories .
For dessert , a serving of McDonald 's apple pie at 262 calories is actually about 40 calories less than a serving of apple pie from the hospital cafeteria .
`` It is important to get cancer patients to eat something high in calories -- french fries , milkshakes , cheeseburgers , '' Grushkin said .

If a typical 3-ton -LRB- 36,000 BTUs per hour -RRB- central air conditioner has an EER of eight , it costs about 36 cents -LRB- at an electric rate of 8 cents per kilowatt hour -RRB- per hour it runs .
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 396 listing manufacturers , model numbers and EER of the 100 highest-efficiency window air conditioners -LRB- 12 in each size range -RRB- from 5,000 to 14,000 BTU per hour cooling capacity , and a detailed work sheet to determine the proper unit for your home .
Its cousin , SEER , or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating , is used to estimate the cost of running an air conditioner over an average cooling season .
The heating efficiency is rated by co-efficient of performance -LRB- COP -RRB- and the cooling efficiency by SEER , like central air conditioners .
Cooling SEER 's are as high as 12 .
QUESTION : Are there any super high-efficiency window air conditioners made ?
Does it make sense to use a window unit even if I have central air conditioning ?
ANSWER : It makes a lot of sense to use a window air conditioner even though you have central air conditioning .
Many new window air conditioners are significantly more efficient than your present central air conditioner .
Instead of making a major expenditure for a new , more efficient central air conditioner , buying a relatively inexpensive , high-efficiency window or through-the-wall air conditioner is sometimes a better investment .
By setting your central air conditioner 's thermostat five degrees higher , you can cut your electric bills up to 25 % , depending on your climate .
Since it runs less , your central air conditioner should require fewer service calls .
Super high-efficiency window air conditioners use special coil and fin designs to improve heat transfer and efficiency .
These features improve the cool air distribution throughout the room or rooms and improve your comfort .
At least it does according to Life magazine , which in 1975 listed the invention of air conditioning among the 100 events that most shaped America .
Introduced in 1902 as a way to control humidity in a Brooklyn printing plant , air conditioning was the brainchild of Willis Carrier , a Cornell University graduate who went on to refine his invention into a compact , practical device capable of cooling everything from movie theaters to passenger trains .
Air conditioning changed America forever .
Perhaps nowhere , however , has air conditioning made so personal an impact upon American life than in the home .
In the 15 years since Life published its list of American milestones , residential air conditioning has gone from a luxury item to an expected part of daily life .
In Orange County , air conditioning for the home took off with the residential building boom of the 1970s .
And yet for large numbers of homeowners , air conditioning remains something of a mystery to be misunderstood and misused -- when it is n't being taken for granted , which is most of the time .
Air conditioning , whether a central system or self-contained window unit , is basically a refrigerator turned extrovert .
In an air conditioner , the cool gaseous Freon passes through coils in the evaporator inside the house where it absorbs heat from the warm interior air .
Put simply , an air conditioner is like a man bailing out a boat -- except in this case the boat is your house , the water is heat , and the bucket is the Freon .
Many people believe that an air conditioner somehow `` makes '' cold air .
The cool breeze coming from the fan of an air conditioner is air that has lost something -- about 20 degrees of heat .
As far as comfort goes , it is as important for an air conditioner to remove moisture from the air as it is to cool that air .
This moisture removal is possible because the colder air becomes , the less water it can hold .
As indoor air reaches its saturation point during the cooling process , the moisture it contains collects on fins inside the air conditioner and drains away .
Think of how a glass of ice water `` sweats '' as warm air cools on contact and gives up its moisture .
An air conditioner works much the same way .
The failure to understand this process of dehumidification can lead a homeowner to choose the wrong air conditioner .
Most people think bigger is better , says Mike Karsten , co-owner of Benchmark Air Systems Inc. in Anaheim .
But an oversize system cools so rapidly that airborne moisture has little chance to condense on collection fins .
`` People I run across in residential sales think choosing air conditioning is like buying a race car .
That is n't the case with air conditioning .
Most new homeowners do n't have to worry about picking the right air conditioner .
`` Up until the mid-1970s , -LRB- residential -RRB- air conditioning was optional , '' Karsten says .
During the `` optional period '' of the last 20 years , air conditioning proved popular and tens of thousands of units were installed .
Ralph Luciano , sales representative for Trane , a large manufacturer of air conditioners , says units today are nearly twice as efficient as they were in the mid-1970s .
`` Fifteen years ago , air conditioners probably ran at -LRB- an Energy Efficiency Rating of -RRB- five or six .
A typical central air-conditioning system for a two -bedroom house may equal three to 3 1/2 tons of cooling capacity , or 36,000 to 42,000 BTUs . -RRB-
Central air conditioners with EERs of 16 or more are gaining popularity with residential customers who want to get the most cooling bang for their energy buck , according to Luciano .
Edison spokesman Kevin Kelley says customers also get billing discounts if they enroll in a `` cycling '' program that will automatically shut off selected residential air conditioners by radio remote control during peak demand times .
The introduction of split systems that use more than one air conditioner to cool several areas in the same house has also helped cut operating costs for homeowners by making it possible to shut down one of the units when its area is not in use .
Indoor air quality is a growing concern to homeowners , especially if a family member suffers from serious allergies .
Throwaway fiber filters remove large airborne particles such as dust , but more advanced -- and more expensive -- electrostatic and electronic filters are needed to trap various microscopic debris that may include animal dander , fungi and even dead skin , according to the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute .
The ACRI also points out that a dirty filter is n't much good for anything except cutting air flow to your system .
Keeping your cool by installing central air in a typical two -bedroom home can run $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 , according to Grupensperger .
For those who want to beat the heat on a budget , there is the economy-class alternative to central cooling , the room air conditioner .
Two years ago , an air conditioner slipped from a seventh -floor window in New York City and plunged to the sidewalk , killing a pedestrian .
Of far more global concern than the errant air conditioner dropping from the sky is the use of chlorofluorocarbons that can escape and pose a threat to the ozone layer .
Researchers have been experimenting with various approaches to air conditioning -- both old and new -- that would eliminate the need for CFCs .
One promising device based on old technology cools air by blowing it through a water mist while at the same time managing the neat trick of removing humidity .
It accomplishes this by adding a desiccant , lithium bromide , to the water to `` dry '' the air as it passes through the spray .
If effective substitutes can be found , the millions of residential and commercial air conditioners now in use could be made ozone -friendly with a simple recharge of the new cooling agents .
What are the newest and highest-efficiency heat pump designs -LRB- for both heating and air conditioning -RRB- available ?
These new heat pumps may also be a cost-effective option for homes with natural gas furnaces and central air conditioners .
A heat pump works both as a furnace and an air conditioner .
When your heating or air conditioning needs are low to moderate , which is the majority of the time , the compressor runs at a lower speed .
In the summer , improved comfort is even more dramatic because continuous and slower operation dehumidifies the air better .
If you have a gas furnace and have to replace your central air conditioner , depending on your local utility rates , a high-efficiency heat pump may be a viable option .

In each of three high-profile festival films - Japan 's Okoge , France 's Les Nuits Fauves and Taiwan 's Golden Bear- winning The Wedding Banquet - a gay relationship is broken into by a heterosexual one , real or token , and the world has a brief , startling glimpse of non-sectarian sexuality .
Pick of the Far East 's two AC/DC entries was Ang Lee 's The Wedding Banquet .
The Wedding Banquet shared an all- Eastern Golden Bear with The Lake Of Scented Souls , reviewed by me last week .
`` LARKS ON A STRING '' -LRB- Czechoslovakia , 1969 ; Director : Jiri Menzel ; Fairfax , 8 : 45 p.m. -RRB- .
How else explain the ability of a French - Polish film with a nonsensical plot premise -a girl from Kracow has an exact double in Clermont Ferrand and dies leaving her a legacy of new awarenesses and sensitivities - to enthrall and enchant us like no European film in recent memory ?
As in earlier films - Camera Buff , No End , A Short Film About Killing - the screen is a mystical assault-course of the ordinary made extraordinary .
But even above and beyond such larger decodings , this beautiful film is its own enigma : as cryptic and glittering as the glass ball in Citizen Kane -LRB- which has a twin here -RRB- and endowed with a soaring human radiance , both in repose and in response , by Irene Jacob .
In each film a loved one dies , leaving the hero or heroine -LRB- s -RRB- to cope with that Great Emotional Beyond called bereavement .
My handkerchief remained unused in Jacques Fansten 's Cross My Heart , although I might have taken it out to wave in surrender as the film keeps firing the same trite story ammunition at us .
A final wave to the 1992 Berlin Film Festival , now departing into history .
We who were there will remember the fine movies , the mixed weather -LRB- snow , sleet , a hint of sun , more sleet -RRB- and the sense of Berlin 's own history playfully processing itself into a souvenir culture .
Did you know you can now buy wooden Russian dolls on the Ku'damm pavements which bear the faces of Gorbachev and Yeltsin ?
No major honour , I rue , for the best film of the final days , Georgia 's The Beloved .
Seldom does a film festival act as midwife to an entire new sub-genre .
But at Berlin a newcomer screamed into the daylight while critics gasped , onlookers applauded and everyone tried to determine whether it was a boy or a girl .
At best the film is vividly personal , like animated pages torn from a diary .
Lee 's film takes a similar plot and turns it into a crowd -pleaser that also makes dramatic and psychological sense .
Nothing else in the Berlin Competition sent one out glowing like these two films .
You winced as you stepped on Holland 's The Homecoming , a darkly ludicrous murder film shot as if by the light of a single candle .
Since the film was co-produced by France and Germany , there are incongruous Euro - actors : notably Charlotte Gainsbourg , Birkin 's niece , as the daughter .
They all sound as if they come the grungier reaches of British suburbia , and an initially unpromising film ends up holding you in sickly , sepulchral thrall .
You recall that brouhaha : film pilloried by agit-gays right up to Oscar time for its picture of a -LRB- seemingly -RRB- homosexual serial killer .
He is losing weight ; his gay friends are offering make-up tips -LRB- 'Tahitian bronze ' to hide the lesions -RRB- ; and the film is offering captions like 'Nine days later ' to stress that this is ticking time- bomb territory , where love and illness meet in a countdown to apocalypse .
Ron Nyswaner 's script plots the film as a legal suspense story , using courtroom scenes to resolve Hanks 's unfair-dismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the payroll and torn up partnership promises .
But what is Kafka , the second film from director Steven -LRB- sex , lies and videotape -RRB- Soderbergh , about ?
A film that might have been 'inspirational ' proves 'inspired ' .
Finally , a brief hat-doffing to the success of these islands at the recent Berlin Film Festival .
The Golden Bear for best actress hugged Crissy Rock in Ken Loach 's new Ladybird , Ladybird .
And Loach himself won the International Critics Prize for his truth-based drama that for all its bureaucracy -walloping OTT tendencies - multiple mother -LRB- Miss Rock -RRB- keeps losing babies to overzealous social workers - had more energy than all the other films in Berlin put together .
`` Coming Out , '' an East German film about a young man 's repressed homosexuality , won the festival 's overall Silver Bear .
Another Golden Bear went as a special anniversary prize to American director Oliver Stone for his film `` Born on the Fourth of July , '' starring Tom Cruise as a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran who becomes a champion of the anti-war movement .
Following are The Times ' recommendations for today 's and Sunday 's schedule of the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival , with commentary by the film reviewing staff .

-LSB- Calderon -RSB- There is nothing new .
Mexico had wanted to sign an agreement with all of the Central American countries , but the pressure exerted by both President Salinas and President Calderon -- both of whom were eager to sign a bilateral agreement of such great significance for their countries -- was decisive .
This agreement is undoubtedly one of President Calderon 's personal victories , and it will represent great benefits for Costa Rica 's development , particularly because it strengthens our independence vis-a-vis the unionist pressure by the remaining Central American countries .

-LSB- Figueres -RSB- I do not think so .
-LSB- Reyes -RSB- In conclusion , Mr. Figueres , did the Honduran president confirm to you and your entourage he will attend your inauguration on 8 May ?
-LSB- Figueres -RSB- He did , and I am very pleased and satisfied over that .
-LSB- Figueres -RSB- A strong embrace , a warm greeting , and wishes of success for the four years that lie ahead .
Figueres , in statements to NOTIMEX , said he considers `` this review of the Cuban case should be done by all the hemisphere 's countries , to find a peaceful solution to the island 's situation . ''
It is a question that relations with that country should take on a new , broader outlook , more in accordance with the international situation , Figueres said .
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol also offers his greetings : -LSB- Calderon Sol -RSB- `` As president of El Salvador , it is a real pleasure to be in this generous nation , Colombia , which opens its arms to welcome all of the Ibero - American leaders .
In a sign of respect and hospitality for President Li 's visit , Jose Maria Figueres , president-elect of Costa Rica , specially convened a joint news conference on the morning of 7 May local time , at which the leaders of the two nations answered correspondents ' questions .
In the communique , President Calderon reiterated the support of his government for the ROC , especially support for the ROC 's bid for membership in the United Nations .
Calderon also thanked the ROC for the economic , technical and cultural cooperation granted by the ROC to Costa Rica .
Li , accompanied by his wife and a delegation of high ranking ROC officials , including Foreign Minister Chien Fu , arrived here Thursday for a three-day visit to meet Calderon and to attend the inauguration of President-elect Jose Maria Figueres .
On Friday , Li had breakfast with Jose Maria Figueres and met separately with President Alfredo Cristiani and President-elect Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador , and Vice President of Paraguay Angel Roberto Seifart .
Li , who is now on a official visit to Costa Rica where he participated in the inauguration of President Jose Maria Figueres Sunday -LSB- 8 May -RSB- , made the remarks during a news conference held following a breakfast meeting with Figueres .
Li said that during the meeting , he and Figueres exchanged opinions on matters related to existing and future cooperation between the two countries .
President Li also pledged during the meeting to increase cooperation with Costa Rica during Figueres ' presidency .
In response , Figueres assured Li that Costa Rica will continue to cooperate with the ROC on the international stage and fight for human rights , democracy and freedom .
-LSB- Begin Figueres recording -RSB- We will always stand on the side of the ROC and continue to fight for the ROC when necessary , so that the ROC will gain deserving status in the international community .
-LSB- end recording -RSB- President Jose Maria Figueres also expressed his wish to visit the ROC after he is sworn in and state affairs are in order , so as to draw on the ROC 's experiences in every field .
-LSB- end recording -RSB- When answering a question at the news conference about solving the issue of Costa Rica 's agricultural development , President Li Teng-hui , an agricultural expert , modestly said that President Jose Maria Figueres , a former agricultural minister , knows more about agriculture than he and surely has concrete plans .
The day 's schedule of important meetings was as follows : At 1030 on 7 May , President Li met incumbent President Alfredo Cristiani and President-Elect Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador .
Outgoing President Calderon presided over the ceremony personally .
Afterward , President Calderon hosted a banquet in the presidential house in honor of President and Mrs Li , the ROC delegation , and distinguished guests from various countries .
Vice President Angel Roberto Seifart will represent President Juan Carlos Wasmosy at the inauguration of Costa Rican President-elect Julio Figueres .
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- -LSB- Reporter -RSB- Let us now listen to President Jose Maria Figueres .
-LSB- Figueres -RSB- We are trying to set up a new axis around which to create a new relationship between the United States and the Central American countries .
-LSB- Figueres -RSB- I understand that President Reina discussed the matter with Vice President Gore during a meeting prior to the meeting with all the presidents .
Today , Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Rafael Angel Calderon of Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement in Mexico City .
Salinas de Gortari and Calderon signed the document at a ceremony in Los Pinos presidential residence after the Costa Rican president 's arrival in Mexico for a two-day visit that will end tomorrow .
`` This treaty will allow a greater flow of commerce and investments between our countries `` and will strengthen the ties of friendship and cooperation between Mexico and Costa Rica , Calderon said in a speech he gave at the event , which was also attended by Salinas de Gortari .
Calderon said : `` The 21st century begins for Costa Ricans `` with the signing of this treaty .
'We should resolve this dialogue without a banana war , ' Mr Calderon said after speaking to the Caribbean leaders .
'The new European regime means lower prices for bananas sold to the United States , ' said Mr Calderon .
Mr Calderon forecast 'victory ' for the Latin Americans in their effort to win enough support at the Gatt and 'morally oblige the Europeans to negotiate with us , although it is not our intention to harm , in any way whatsoever , the exports of Caribbean countries . '
Our people have always maintained good relations in the past and , undoubtably , will continue to do so in the future with the new Costa Rican president as of May and with whomever you elect to govern Panama during the 8 May elections .
-LSB- Unidentified reporter -RSB- What is the status of bilateral trade between Panama and Costa Rica ?
Very small differences have appeared regarding certain products , but through dialogue , as we have always done , Panama and Costa Rica have managed to reach an agreement and resolve our differences .
The trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico , which goes into force on 1 January 1995 , will constitute Costa Rica 's first step toward joining NAFTA , which has been signed by Mexico , the United States , and Canada .
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today said the U.S. blockade against Cuba `` is not the proper medicine '' to get this country to return to a democratic system .
The head of Costa Rican diplomacy said : `` None of us want our Cuban brothers to shed one drop of blood .
Today Niehaus met with foreign reporters covering Costa Rica 's electoral process that ends tomorrow with the election of a new president , two vice presidents , 57 deputies , and authorities for the 81 Costa Rican municipalities .
Good evening , Mr. President .
This is a very important day for my country because the free trade agreement with Mexico will create extraordinary opportunities for development in Costa Rica .
-LSB- Zabludovsky -RSB- Could you briefly tell us how the agreements signed today will benefit Costa Rica and Mexico ?
By the same token , our free trade agreement with Mexico means that Costa Rica is entering a country with a population of 90 million citizens , a country with a growing economy , a country that will become part of the First World at the beginning of the 21st century through the free trade agreement .
-LSB- Zabludovsky -RSB- Last night Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro expressed her hope that Nicaragua will also join this agreement .
Do you think the free trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico can be extended to other countries in the area ?
That has been President Salinas de Gortari 's wish from the beginning .
Costa Rica had the opportunity to advance and persevered until the agreement was signed today .
The rest of Central America will follow to acquire the same advantages that Mexico has given Costa Rica today .
This afternoon , around 1400 , Mexico and Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement at Los Pinos Presidential Palace .
During the ceremony to sign the document , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said the free trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico will promote greater trade and investment , employment , and welfare opportunities for both nations .
President Salinas spoke about the diversification of relations between Mexico and other countries and the advantages of competition .
He gave a long speech in which he said that 5 April marked the onset of the 21st century for Costa Rica and praised President Salinas , comparing him with Bolivar , Marti , Juarez , and San Martin .
This agreement will have significant repercussions for the future of all citizens , and it heralds a new period in relations between Mexico and Costa Rica and between Costa Rica and the other North American nations .
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Diaz -RSB- This free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa Rica is considered the most thorough agreement negotiated in Latin America .
This treaty , as you have said , if ratified by the Mexican and Costa Rican senates , will enter into force on 1 January 1995 .
A large number of the tariffs will be eliminated -- in the case of Mexican exports , 70 percent , while in the case of Costa Rican exports , 75 percent .
-LSB- Announcer -RSB- The signing of this treaty is beneficial for Costa Rica , as well as for Mexico , of course .
Costa Rica currently exports -- according to 1993 statistics -- an average of $ 60 million to Mexico , mainly raw materials .
With the signing of this bilateral free trade agreement , Costa Rica will be able to increase it sale of goods and services to Mexico 400 percent .
That is , the current value of the market , which is $ 60 million , could grow to $ 250 million , which is very beneficial for Costa Rica and the Mexican commercial opening .
According to several government officials , following the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesday , 5 April , Costa Rica 's priority is to become part of NAFTA before the rest of Central America .
Officials in both governments said that after three years of negotiations , Mexico and Costa Rica signed the `` most advanced '' commercial treaty in Latin America .
The future president stressed the need to train experienced negotiators so they can make the best of the difficult trade negotiations ahead , particularly with a view to joining NAFTA , formed by Mexico , the United States , and Canada on 1 January .
Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas , who has been responsible for trade negotiations so far , said that the agreement with Mexico puts Costa Rica in a `` privileged '' position for its integration into NAFTA .
He added that before such an agreement can be signed , `` the right internal , economic , and institutional conditions must exist , and Costa Rica found them '' in the negotiations with Mexico .
According to Rojas , it would take approximately 10 years to join NAFTA if the negotiations were carried out in concert with the other Central American nations , and he predicted that it will take two years for Costa Rica to sign a free trade agreement with the rest of Central America .
The treaty with Mexico gives Costa Rica access to a market 30 times larger than the Costa Rican market .
Business associations and government officials expect a significant boost in foreign investment and commercial trade , which currently represents a deficit for Costa Rica .
In 1993 , Costa Rica exported approximately $ 60 million and imported $ 150 million , mostly in oil purchases , from Mexico .
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday that it was `` excellent '' that Costa Rica had signed the agreement because it can serve as an example for the other countries in the region , which are currently in preliminary negotiations with Mexico .
The subject was included on President Violeta Chamorro 's agenda during her official visit to Mexico , which concluded on Wednesday .
-LSB- Reyes -RSB- Mr. President-elect , will Central America 's integration be strengthened now that Costa Rica will be participating directly and firmly , and did you discuss Central America 's drug-trafficking problem with President Reina ?
We have that same idea in Costa Rica .
Drug trafficking is one of modern society 's everyday problems today , and we must do everything within our capability so that the problem will not affect Honduras , Costa Rica and , of course , other countries .
-LSB- Reyes -RSB- Will you continue to visit Honduras after you are president ?
-LSB- Reyes -RSB- Was Central American integration the main topic you discussed with the Honduran president ?
Costa Rica is keenly interested in making a significant contribution to a more effective and beneficial integration by all of our countries .
-LSB- Reyes -RSB- Has your assembly made any arrangements for Costa Rica to finally become a member of all the Central American organizations ?
Certain sectors in Costa Rica oppose joining the Central American Parliament , however , and I hope that as time passes we will gradually defeat that position .
Costa Rica will always be at your service to help as much as it can , be it a little or much .
The president has repeatedly said that the solution to the Cuban problem should be dealt with through negotiations at the hemispheric level , to avoid bloodshed in Cuba .
During the last UN General Assembly , Costa Rica voted with the majority of countries against the U.S. blockade of Cuba .
Costa Rica considers the U.S. -imposed blockade of Cuba a violation of international law contrary to the spirit of free trade , which the United States promised to respect through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- .
The foreign minister clarified that `` Costa Rica is not willing to support actions that condemn a people to hunger , poverty , and oppression , because respect of all human rights is part and parcel of being Costa Rican . ''
`` If Costa Rica is able to contribute anything , if Costa Rica can add its grain of sand to find a solution to Cuba 's crisis , we are willing to play that role , because passivity is the worst mistake at this moment , '' Naranjo stressed .
The foreign minister said that `` hopefully all Costa Ricans will join together to encourage a hemispheric position in the case of Cuba , and this is in full agreement with the democratic principles the American continent today brandishes with pride . ''
At 1615 -LSB- 2115 GMT -RSB- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori arrived .
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro also greets the Colombian people on Radio Caracol .
This is Violeta Barrios de Chamorro , the president of Nicaragua . ''
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina briefly addressed the Colombian people .
Because of the imminent changeover of government in Costa Rica , the conference hall was packed with correspondents from various countries who came to cover the inauguration .
Asked about democracy in Costa Rica and what we can learn from Costa Rica 's experience of democracy , President Li said : Costa Rica has been a model democracy of late , because all the institutions in Costa Rica are founded on the idea of power belonging to the people .
Power is being transferred peacefully in Costa Rica from the outgoing president to the incoming president , and there is no uneasiness over the changeover of political power .
Aware of the presence of a XINHUA correspondent , President Li changed the subject by pointing out : The foremost problem on mainland China is who is going to be the successor .
Looking at the democratic institutions in Costa Rica , we should know that lasting peace and stability must be founded on institutions .
President Li said : `` The expression that power belongs to the people is an old saying ; it is , as a matter of fact , also very timely .
At this point , President Li said with emotion that he has a dream .
There has never been a president in China , in the ROC , who has handed over power to another a person while he was still alive .

President Li , on his part , committed to further strengthen the cooperation and friendship between two countries .
President Li Teng -hui of the Republic of China -LSB- ROC -RSB- said here over the weekend that the ROC would actively participate in international affairs as a sovereign nation .
The Republic of China -LSB- ROC -RSB- and Costa Rica will continue strengthening bilateral cooperation and support , ROC President Li Teng-hui said over the weekend .
The Governments of the ROC and Costa Rica have traditionally supported each other in international affairs , Li said , adding that Costa Rica has demonstrated its sincere willingness to help forward the ROC 's bid to enter the United Nations .
Through an interpreter , he stressed that Costa Rica will continue its efforts to help the ROC gain deserving status in the international community .
He also pointed out that it is appropriate for the ROC to join the UN and that at every occasion Costa Rica will support the ROC , which firmly defends democracy and has traditional ties of friendship with Costa Rica .
President Li Teng-hui expressed heartfelt thanks for the promise by the new Costa Rican Government .
-LSB- Begin President Li recording -RSB- It is very important for the two sides to foster mutual understanding .
On the second day of his stay in Costa Rica , Republic of China -LSB- ROC -RSB- President Li Teng-hui , in additional to making official calls , met separately with leaders of El Salvador and several other nations who were in Costa Rica to participate in the inauguration of its new president .
These meetings , which were among the most important items on the schedule of President Li 's tour of Central America , are of considerable significance for enhancing the ROC 's -LSB- word indistinct -RSB- with its friendly nations .
During the meetings , it was expected that President Li would try to enlist the leaders ' support for the ROC 's bid to participate in UN activities .
At 1115 , he met Angel Roberto Seifart , vice president of Paraguay .
In the afternoon , he met with Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas -LSB- as heard -RSB- and later with Guatelaman President De Leon Carpio .
Besides President Li , other heads of state who came to participate in the inauguration included the leaders of Nicaragua , Honduras , El Salvador , Colombia , and Guatelama .
After accepting the medal , President Li emphasized that the medal is not only a personal honor but also symbolizes the noble and sincere friendship between China and Costa Rica .
He pledged that the ROC Government would continue its efforts to enhance cooperation with the Costa Rican Government .
China Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Kang You-feng filed the following report : The presentation ceremony was held on the evening of 6 May , Costa Rican time .

Interior Minister Carlos Podesta is accompanying the vice president .
Seifart advised Congress of his trip to Costa Rica thus fulfilling a constitutional requirement .
It is a great pleasure and honor to be here today in the presence of the Central American presidents and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore .
We had a very interesting meeting which was enriched by the opinions of the U.S. Vice President , who has had a very brilliant career in his country , in the House of Representatives , the Senate , and in politics .
The vice president wanted us to discuss very important issues , including sustainable development and good government -LSB- previous two words in English -RSB- , which I call social revolution in Honduras ; in other words , a government that makes scrupulous efforts to become not only efficient but absolutely honest in the handling of funds and in its social policies ; a government that strengthens the principles of democracy and consolidates those values to achieve development with a humanistic consideration , which is what we have talked about in the past .
Vice President Gore will address you , and afterward , you may pose appropriate questions , and the vice president , I , or the presidents of Central America will answer them .
Mr. Vice President , welcome to Honduras ; this is the press from my country .

-LSB- Reporter -RSB- Mr. President , specifically now , what kind of action can the U.S. Vice President carry out , or what degree of influence could he have to channel funds toward Central American countries ?
Today , the vice president himself announced what we were going to request of him : trade equality .
With the United States and the vice president integrated as external partners of the BCIE , we would obviously have better access to funds from the United States .
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- Mr. President , we would like to know if the vice president made any commitment about preventing what is known as Central American forum flu -LSB- trancazo de los foros centroamericanos -RSB- and if it is in fact avoidable ?

The men did not even allow the Guatemalan president to answer the question .
In addition to U.S. Vice President Gore and the Honduran president , the presidents of Costa Rica and Guatemala participated and spoke in detail on the subjects discussed during this joint meeting of the Central American presidents and the U.S. Vice President .
Costa Rica is the first Central American country to sign a free trade agreement with Mexico .
He said the agreement represents `` a great step toward '' Costa Rica 's future integration into NAFTA , signed by Canada , the United States , and Mexico , which has been in effect since January .
Costa Rica is not a member of the community but is seeking observer status .
'There is a glimmer of hope in the Costa Rican statement that a banana war should be avoided , ' said Mr John Compton , the prime minister of St Lucia , one of the four islands of the Windward group whose economies are heavily dependent on bananas .

For them the premium New York return fare of Pounds 5,000 is justified by the savings in travelling time offered by Concorde .
A standard British Airways return fare to New York costs Pounds 5,030 plus tax - Pounds 670 per hour on board - while a cheap-day Concorde return is priced at Pounds 4,156 .
The scheduled Washington service , which was Concorde 's first transatlantic route , has averaged passenger loads of only 30 per cent compared with an average of about 70 per cent for the New York service , which has round-trip ticket prices of more than Pounds 5,000 .
Despite all the initial optimism of the 1960s , when the project 's cost was put at Pounds 80m and Britain and France were hoping to sell more than 400 aircraft , only 16 were actually built and the overall cost eventually reached Pounds 2bn .
With mid-morning departures from London and Paris the busy senior executive has time to sort out his desk before departure and still be in New York 's JFK airport at 9.30am the same day -LRB- or 9am on the Air France flight -RRB- after a flight of just 3 1/2 hours .
The group has been concentrating on three main issues , the technological requirements for a second generation supersonic airliner , environmental considerations and finally the potential market for the new jet .
Like the airlines , the aerospace industry believes the only real questions are when a new supersonic aircraft will be built , and who will be in the final consortium .
Concorde , with its payload of only 100 seats , has always been viewed as a 'top persons ' airliner ' , with a premium fare which has limited its market .
Some believe that demand in the first quarter of the next century could justify up to as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft , worth some Dollars 200-300bn , collectively carrying up to as many as 600,000 passengers a day .
Although he emphasises no formal decision to go ahead has been taken , Mr McKinlay believes any new supersonic aircraft would need to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes , fly at between Mach 2 and Mach 2.25 and have a range in excess of 5,500 miles compared to Concorde 's 3,500 miles .
The range is critical because it would open up new high density routes such as the trans-Pacific routes from America 's west coast to Asia , for instance Los Angeles to Tokyo .
But to achieve ranges of that order , the new aircraft will need to utilise high technology , low weight materials and a specialised power plant - probably a form of variable cycle engine which would help it meet some of the environmental noise objections while flying at subsonic speeds .
Such an aircraft could cut many long distance journey times in half and help attract new travellers to supersonic flight .
It may be a soul -stirring experience to arrive in New York an hour and 10 minutes before you departed - the flight leaves daily at 10.30am and touches down at JFK at 9.20am - but most souls can be stirred for a much more modest sum .
Another Concorde idea for the festive season is the so-called Atlantic Time Tunnel which offers the chance to celebrate New Year 's Eve twice in the same year .
Two nights later , Concorde takes you on to New York for a Bloomingdale 's reception -LRB- Dollars 10,000 to spend for one lucky passenger -RRB- and from there , on January 3 , back to London .
The standard Concorde return fare to Barbados is Pounds 4,228 .
They will not be those for whom Concorde is merely a rapid means of shuttling between important meetings in London , New York and Washington .
Scheduled passengers , by all accounts , spend the 3 1/2 -hour transatlantic trip looking underwhelmed -LRB- but smart -RRB- , sipping carbonated water , waving away expensive food and giving the impression that , for them , Concorde is a weekly event .
They will be seeking cash aid from national governments and from Brussels for the project , which is estimated to cost the makers as much as Dollars 15bn -LRB- Pounds 10.20bn -RRB- for a maximum demand of 1,000 aircraft .
It has been in discussion with the UK Department of Trade and Industry about assistance for the new project .
British Airways yesterday said it was suspending its loss-making Concorde scheduled service between London and Washington DC after 18 years .
BA , which will continue to operate its profitable twice-daily London - New York Concorde services , plans to develop supersonic charter flights for the US market .
After the end of its thrice-weekly scheduled Concorde Washington service from November 8 BA will permanently base one of its seven Concordes at New York 's JFK airport .
BA has already won business to operate a weekly Concorde charter flight between New York and Barbados for three months starting in December .
BA said : 'We see possibilities for expanding charter services from New York to South America , Bermuda and Mexico . '
The suspension of BA 's service to Washington 's Dulles airport means that New York is the only US destination served by regular supersonic scheduled services from London Heathrow - operated by BA - and Paris Charles de Gaulle , operated by Air France .
The trip will start in London on April 1 and finish there on April 23 .
The fare is $ 39,000 per person based on double occupancy or $ 40,500 for a single passenger .

The following is a compilation of fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana radio and television in Spanish between 23 and 29 May : Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 May reports that Noel Adrian , general director of the Cuban - French enterprise Havana Club Internacional , has announced in Santiago de Cuba that Havana Club rum will be officially launched in France , Belgium , England , and other European countries in July .
The radio also reports that innovators from the Ministry of Construction 's Enterprise No. 1 in Pinar del Rio Province have developed a cement-hardener made from molasses and other materials available locally .
Rum is distilled wherever sugar cane is grown and in a few places where it is not .
There is African rum from Nigeria , Kenya or South Africa ; Indian rum reeking of petrol ; Australian rum , which in its heyday was aged in old wine casks from the Hunter Valley ; and north and south American rum .
Some rums from the former Spanish colonies were predictably fashioned for the sweet-toothed : Ron Colonial , a golden rum from Guatamala , or Ron Artemi from the Canary Islands , for example .
Cuba had its own style of white , un-aged rum , of which Bacardi is now the best known example , even if it is now no longer made in Cuba and is these days less of a rum than a popular white spirit .
Both a white rum , and a three-year-old , golden , banana-smelling rum are available here .
Most are made in column stills which produce a less pungent spirit than that made in Jamaica , and one which needs a longer process of maturation .
Martinique white rums do n't impress me much , perhaps because I am reluctant to see any drink submerged beneath a liquidised fruit cocktail .
The 1966 was a dream , an absolute must for anyone who doubts rum 's ability to hold its own among the world 's great digestifs .
From the Domaine de Montebello came a 1948 rum which was magnificently spicy : cinnamon , cloves and ginger .
In the old British colonies many of the rums were made in pot stills using molasses as opposed to the cane juice preferred by the French .
Ben Cross de Chavannes , a veteran rum trader , showed me some startling figures relating to the ester-count in Jamaican rums .
During the Great War these were the only spirits made available to the Jamaicans , and they developed a taste for them .
Anyone wishing to try a subtle white rum from a British island , should sample The Baron 's CSR from St Kitts , which is remarkably smooth .
Cockspur is a golden rum with a well-mannered drink with a faintly nutmeg-like aroma .
Two rather more house -tamed rums are El Dorado Demerara rum -LRB- from Guyana -RRB- and Alfred Lamb reserve .
The 15-year-old Guyanese rum has a smell which reminded me of angelica .

US scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible for multiple sclerosis .
The discovery by Stanford University researchers working with Neurocrine Biosciences , a San Diego -based biotechnology company , could lead eventually to a cure for MS , which afflicts more than 2.6m people worldwide .
By good fortune , it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes MS in rats ; having an animal model always speeds up drug development .
Once a blocking technique has been developed , it may eventually become possible to use 'growth factors ' to repair the damaged tissues in MS patients .
But the ultimate cause of MS - what triggers the T- cells to attack - is not yet understood .
Demand for the first drug proven to have an effect against multiple sclerosis , Betaseron , outstrips supply to such an extent that a lottery is used to decide which patients should receive it .
When Schering of Germany launched Betaseron last September in the US , the only country in which it is licensed for sale , doctors registered 80,000 MS patients who wanted the drug .
Meanwhile two competing beta-interferons , developed by Ares-Serono of Switzerland and Biogen of the US , are moving through clinical trials in MS patients .
Besides the interferons , many other 'new generation ' MS drugs are at various stages of research and development .
Together they represent progress on a broad front against MS , the most common disease of the nervous system in young adults , which affects an estimated 2m people worldwide .
Effective MS treatments could give the pharmaceutical industry a huge new market .
Although the precise molecular cause of MS is not yet known , scientists agree that it is an auto-immune disease in the same broad category as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes .
In the worst cases of 'chronic-progressive MS ' the neurological problems become steadily more severe and eventually kill the patient .
In 'relapsing-remitting MS ' the disease flares up at unpredictable intervals - and may even disappear spontaneously .
Neither beta-interferon nor the other experimental drugs can cure MS but , for the first time , they do promise a significant amelioration in the disease .
MS specialists such as George Ebers , a Canadian neurologist at the University Hospital , London , Ontario , are understandably cautious about claims for new treatments because 'there have been so many false dawns - therapies which have been widely used but found on further study to be ineffective ' .
Researchers also claimed success with drugs such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin , which suppress the patient 's whole immune system , but these too turned out to be ineffective against MS when tested properly .
Tested under those conditions on patients with relapsing-remitting MS , Betaseron reduced the number of attacks by one third and reduced significantly the amount of nerve damage shown by magnetic resonance imaging .
All three kinds - alpha , beta and gamma - have been tested on MS .
Alpha had no effect , while gamma made the disease worse ; scientists now believe natural gamma-interferon may play a role in the progression of MS .
Most of the other MS treatments under development aim to disable the specific part of the immune system that is responsible for MS , without suppressing the other immune functions that are essential for fighting disease .
These are aimed either at specific types of T-cell which the researchers believe are responsible for the immune attack in MS or at 'antigens ' in the myelin which provoke the attack .
However , there is vigorous debate between MS specialists about whether the fundamental defect lies in a very narrow sub-group of T- cells - in which case a specific drug could in theory cure the disease - or whether a wider range of immune cells are responsible .
If so , MS will be harder to treat .
The virus used in the vaccine , HTLV-1 , has also been linked to multiple sclerosis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and certain other rare neurological conditions , and is endemic among intravenous drug users in certain eastern urban areas such as New York City .
In January , Greenberg and a group from the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia reported independently that they had found traces of HTLV-1 or a virus very much like it in many patients with multiple sclerosis , a chronic disease of the central nervous system that afflicts about 250,000 people in the U.S .
A broad series of experiments suggest that it may be possible to defuse the immune system in humans to treat and even prevent diseases like multiple sclerosis and diabetes .
Moreover , researchers at Harvard are already using special antibodies in humans in an attempt to knock out MS patients ' own antibodies that are producing the disease .
The Harvard researchers are also vaccinating some MS patients with immune cells in an attempt to protect them from the ravages of the disease .
MS is a paralyzing neurological disease that affects as many as 250,000 people in the United States .
In rodents and some other animals , an MS -like disease called experimental allergic encephalitis -LRB- EAE -RRB- can be produced by injecting the animals with ground-up nerve tissue .
In an overreaction to the injected tissues , the animals ' immune systems begin to attack their own nerve tissues , producing MS symptoms .
MS researchers in the past have used drugs that wipe out all T cells in an attempt to halt the progression of MS , but such drugs leave the MS patient highly susceptible to life-threatening infections .
If , for example , they know which specific type of T cell is attacking neural sheaths in EAE , the animal form of MS , they can produce special antibodies , called monoclonal antibodies , that bind to the T cells and help destroy them .
Neurologist Howard L. Weiner and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston have used such antibodies to treat about 20 human MS patients .
In their safety trials , they have shown that the antibodies suppress the functioning of the T cells thought to be involved in MS , but they are not yet sure if they produced any remission of the disease because MS often goes into remission spontaneously .
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease that causes weakness , tremors and paralysis in as many as 250,000 Americans .
Researchers in San Diego have developed a vaccine against an animal disease that mimics the effects of multiple sclerosis in humans , according to an article in Thursday 's issue of Science magazine .
Continuing research in San Diego and elsewhere now suggests that doctors might one day be able to prevent and treat diseases such as MS and diabetes , both of which occur when the body 's immune system goes awry .
MS is a chronic disease that causes weakness , tremors and paralysis .
The San Diego -based researchers and the Portland group are using synthetic molecules to immunize mice against experimental allergic encephalitis -LRB- EAE -RRB- , an animal virus that produces MS -like symptoms .
MS and EAE occur when the body is attacked by its own immune system .
The researchers report in the journal Nature today that they have identified the specific type of white blood cell -LRB- T-cell -RRB- responsible for the attack - and matched its genetic sequence to a corresponding gene on the myelin protein .
Lawrence Steinman , leader of the Stanford/Neurocrine research team , says the scientists are following three approaches : The primary effort is to make a 'molecular decoy ' which can attract the T- cells away from the myelin .
The body 's immune system , which is intended to defend it against germs and other foreign invaders , turns against its own cells .
Symptoms include partial paralysis , blurred vision and speech difficulties .
Until now , doctors have only been able to offer patients 'comfort therapy ' such as pain- killers and anti-inflammatory drugs , which control some of the symptoms but have no effect on the underlying disease .
According to Ares-Serono , it may both decrease the activity of the immune cells that destroy myelin and counteract the disease-enhancing effects of gamma-interferon .
As a result they have sugar chains on the protein surface , like natural human interferon but unlike the Schering product .
In theory this could give them a clinical advantage - in terms of fewer side-effects and improved efficacy - but there is no evidence to show whether they work better in practice .
It suppresses harmful T- cells and may also stimulate the regrowth of damaged myelin .
Myloral , a formulation of bovine -LRB- cow -RRB- myelin , developed by AutoImmune , a Massachusetts biotechnology company .
The patient is fed the protein so that the immune system comes to tolerate it and therefore is less inclined to attack his or her own myelin .
Copolymer-1 -LRB- Cop-1 -RRB- , a synthetic chemical resembling myelin protein , developed by Teva in Israel .
When injected into the patient , this decoy attracts the immune cells away from the real myelin .

`` I think it is going to be a source of great excitement in the neurological and virological communities . ''
Unlike most disease-producing viruses , whose genetic information is contained in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid -LRB- DNA -RRB- like that found in all animal and human cells , retroviruses encode their genetic information in ribonucleic acid -LRB- RNA -RRB- .
Olsen has found traces of the virus in patients with lupus , an autoimmune disorder in which the victims ' immune systems attack their connective tissues and internal organs .
Olsen 's vaccine does not contain the virus itself , but proteins that are secreted by HTLV - 1 -infected animal cells that are grown in the laboratory .
In the development of the feline leukemia virus , Olsen found that these precursor proteins produce a greater immune response than the viral proteins themselves and are less likely to produce harmful effects .
That is an important finding , Olsen argued , because most potential AIDS vaccines now being studied use only one type of protein or the other , and are thus less likely to be effective .
`` More than one protein is going to be necessary '' for an AIDS vaccine , he said in a telephone interview .
But white blood cells from the nine vaccinated monkeys showed no evidence of viral activity , suggesting that the vaccine protected them from the virus .
Olsen agrees , and is now using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search for the viral genes in white blood cells from the vaccinated monkeys .
Only about 1 % of people infected by the virus actually develop disease , he said , so a vaccine would have to have a very low incidence of side effects to justify using it .
The disease occurs when the victim 's immune system goes awry and attacks the insulating protein sheath that surrounds nerve cells , effectively short-circuiting nerve impulses and producing the disease 's characteristic symptoms : weakness , tremors , disturbances of speech and vision , and ultimately paralysis .
The attack is carried out by immune cells , called T cells , that normally proliferate in response to an infection and destroy the foreign invader .
The goal of most research now is to deactivate only those specific T cells that are attacking the nerve sheath while leaving the rest of the immune system intact .
In passive immunization , the researchers attack the T cells that have already been formed .
In an active approach , such as that reported today in the journal Nature , the researchers hope to prevent the formation of the destructive T cells in the first place .
For 10 years , Cohen has been isolating from rodents the T cells that cause EAE , diabetes and arthritis , treating them with radiation or chemicals to deactivate them so they do not cause harm , and injecting them back into the animals .
The immune system produced antibodies against the injected T cells -- and thus against the identical T cells produced by the animals ' bodies .
These antibodies hold the T cells in check and thereby block progression of the disease .
Weiner has already tried this approach in three human patients , isolating T cells from spinal fluid , deactivating them , and reinjecting them .
Neurologist Arthur A. Vandenbark and his colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland , Ore. , synthesized a small chemical , called a peptide , that is a key part of the T cells that are involved in EAE .
When they vaccinated rats with the peptide , the rats no longer developed EAE when they were subsequently injected with ground nerve tissue .
This approach is preferable to the use of whole cells because it is more widely applicable .
In treating humans , the patient 's own deactivated cells must be used so that the injection does not cause an adverse immune reaction .
In both diseases , cells that normally keep organisms healthy by destroying foreign cells inexplicably attack nerve cells and cause neurological diseases .

Video shows nuclear submarine in Arctic waters , investigating expedition with underwater apparatus , clips and stills of Komsomolets on the seabed , interviews with officials `` The Komsomolets is not the first nuclear submarine to suffer an accident but it is the first whose nuclear reactor has leaked. ''
KOPRON is being disbanded and so are the mobile structures carrying out active preparations for the conservation of warheads on the Komsomolets . ''
This book was published with the assistance of the Nuclear- Powered Submarine `` Komsomolets '' Memorial Charity .
Thus the opinion of the workers of ship building industry regarding the causes of the tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' never was brought to the awareness of the people , which is what compelled me to write this book .
The documentary narrative `` The Tragedy of the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' '' can not be considered to be the labor of a single author .
From the first days the author was actively involved in designing , building and commissioning the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and he participated personally in the most critical trials and practical tests of the specific possibilities of the unique ship as a whole , and of the technical concepts embodied in its design .
A deep knowledge of all of the circumstances of the tragedy and a high level of technical erudition combined with honesty and principles led the author to his own opinion regarding the causes of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' and the subsequent demise of it and its crew of 42 .
In the book offered here to the reader , D. A. Romanov persuasively demonstrates that the main cause of the tragedy in the Sea of Norway was something other than technical imperfections in the ship 's design or insufficient reliability of the equipment installed aboard the ship -- in this regard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' differed favorably from most Soviet submarines .
A. Vanin 's poorly trained crew was sent off on that fateful cruise aboard the ill-prepared submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Different hypotheses regarding the causes of the tragedy of the Soviet nuclear-powered submarine `` Komsomolets '' have been stated in numerous articles published in a number of newspapers and journals by representatives of the navy .
The submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not differ in any way from modern submarines currently in operation in terms of the composition of combat and technical resources , including its control systems and its damage control systems .
In 1988 the submarine was recognized as an outstanding submarine , and it was awarded the name `` Komsomolets '' .
Preparation of the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' for Launching
The Crew According to the detail design , the submarine `` Komsomolets '' should have been serviced by highly qualified specialists from among officers and warrant officer technicians .
This reduction of professional level , `` planned '' by the navy 's elite , affected not only the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' but also all other submarines .
For some reason it was not until after the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' that the Main Naval Staff came to understand that `` the crews of ships of this type should be manned only by officers and warrant officers , because compulsory-service seamen and petty officers lack the means to adequately master operation of a submarine in such a short time. '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 6 -LSB- / -RSB-
`` Komsomolets '' crew members were questioned in a fault finding manner by the State Commission , which also contains representatives of industry .
A news brief appeared in the 13 May 1989 edition of PRAVDA regarding decoration of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
as : `` And in the training center where both of the crews had been `` perfected , '' they hastened to write an unfavorable performance report on Vanin , the deceased commander of the `` Komsomolets '' , second-guessing the usual course of thinking of the supreme leadership : `` criminal negligence '' . ''
But knowing the make-up of the command of the division to which the submarine `` Komsomolets '' belonged , I dare to assert that none of the division 's flag- officer specialists were well enough versed in the material of this submarine to rule adequately on performance in damage control problems .
`` It so happened that the crew of the `` Komsomolets '' would not accept the former deputy commander for political affairs , and did not wish to go out to sea with him '' is how N. Cherkashin explains this event. -LSB- . sup -RSB- 13 -LSB- / -RSB-
Preparations for the Cruise : Routine inspection and maintenance and work to correct existing faults were carried out prior to the cruise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in accordance with regulations .
The trial run of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' demonstrated the need for creating such a crew .
In order that the full volume of routine maintenance and inspection could be carried out within the established time aboard a `` Komsomolets '' class submarine , not less than 200 -250 highly qualified specialists must be brought in .
Everything said here is completely valid in relation to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' as well .
But let 's return to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
As is confirmed in the joint act of two sections of the government commission 's working group , `` Operation and Damage Control '' and `` Ship Building , '' the `` Komsomolets '' set out to sea for patrol duty in serviceable condition .
The work order for refitting of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' between cruises , which was signed off by division commander Rear Admiral O. T. Shkiryatov and approved by flotilla deputy commander Rear Admiral L. B. Nikitin , foresaw repair of television system equipment -LRB- one of the television cameras of this system was in compartment 7 of the submarine -RRB- and the oxygen gas analyzer for compartment 7 -LRB- items 7 and 71 of the work order -RRB- .
An examination of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' with deep-sea submersibles in August - September 1991 revealed that it lacked an aft outboard television camera .
Prior to the patrol the `` Komsomolets '' took aboard stores of provisions , bed linens , underwear , warm clothing and other gear and supplies for 69 persons intended for full self-sufficiency ; in this case part of these provisions and supplies -LRB- including bread -RRB- were stored in compartment 7 , even though their storage here is not foreseen by the design documents .
Such was the `` readiness '' of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the difficult cruise .
And so , on 28 February 1989 the submarine `` Komsomolets '' set off on its cruise .
On 8 August 1988 the naval command and the USSR Ministry of Ship Building Industry adopted a joint decision to use the `` Komsomolets '' purposefully , in a special scientific research program .
Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev , the chief of the Naval Main Directorate for Operation and Repair , had something somewhat different to say about this in his conclusion to the `` Analysis of the Personnel 's Damage Control Actions Aboard the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' , '' carried out by a group of specialists from the Naval Academy imeni N. G. Kuznetsov under the leadership of Vice Admiral Ye .
N. Patrushev communicated in letter No. 47/0220 dated 17 February 1989 that the scientific research program `` can not be carried out in 1989 because the plan for utilization of ships in 1989 approved by the naval commander -in- chief did not foresee use of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in a special program. ''
Such are the myths and realities regarding the goals of the last cruise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The Submarine `` Komsomolets '' on Patrol
I have before me the `` Extract From the Draft Ship 's Log of the Nuclear-Powered Submarine `` Komsomolets '' '' authenticated by the Northern Fleet chief of staff Vice Admiral Yu .
There was one aboard the `` Komsomolets '' as well .
As was mentioned earlier , the `` Manual on Combat Use of Technical Resources '' -LRB- RBITS -RRB- had not been written by Naval Institute No. 1 for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
2 . The deflagration did not start a fire in the compartment , which says something about the rather high fire resistance of the `` Komsomolets '' submarine .
At 1250 the headquarters of the Northern Fleet transmitted a radio message to the `` Komsomolets '' forbidding the ship 's submergence and suggesting it remain adrift .
Apparently the command of the `` Komsomolets '' lacked not only the ability to organize ship damage control efforts but also the courage to report the status of the submarine objectively and promptly .
This is apparently the result of the `` Komsomolets '' leadership misinforming the Northern Fleet command .
The absence of complete information on exchanges between the distressed submarine and the Northern Fleet 's command post makes it impossible to determine what the grounds were for dispatching the KAS-150 -LRB- did the `` Komsomolets '' ask for them , or was this the initiative of the command post ? -RRB- .
And even in these last minutes of the tragedy , the leadership of the `` Komsomolets '' lacked the courage to communicate the whole truth to the Northern Fleet 's command post .
At the same time the Northern Fleet 's command post transmitted the following command to the `` Komsomolets '' by way of the tender `` Aleksey Khlobystov '' : `` Use the commander 's VVD group to blow the aft group of ballast tanks .
But high-placed representatives of the navy decided to forestall the `` probable adversary '' and publish most of the secret data on the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in the open press , and the initiative in this belongs to commander -in- chief Fleet Admiral V. N. Chernavin in the 13 May 1989 edition of the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA .
As an example he cited the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Just due to this , members of the `` Komsomolets '' crew failed to put on survival suits , and did not take their safety vests and life jackets .
The one thing that the leadership of the `` Komsomolets '' did manage to do was to report to the Northern Fleet 's command post back at 1641 that the personnel were ready for evacuation .
The `` Komsomolets '' is the only submarine in the navy that carries rafts outside the pressure hull .
The rafts of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' were in hard containers , each with two rack -and -pinion releases .
In the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , rather than dropping the inflatable raft onto the water in its container , and then activating the gas inflating system by tugging the inflating line , the personnel , who were not trained in the rules of using such a raft , undid the lacing and extracted the raft from its container .
At 1645 the Northern Fleet commander ordered the commander of the `` Komsomolets '' to prepare the rescue chamber -LRB- VSK -RRB- for separation from the submarine .
As is the case aboard other submarines , the rescue chamber of the `` Komsomolets '' is intended for the rescue of the entire crew when the submarine is on the bottom .
The submarine `` Komsomolets '' began sinking with a trim of around 80ë by the stern .
The ignorance of the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' of the physical laws and principles of action of the rescue chamber releasing devices can be clearly discerned in this episode .
A review of video tapes and photographs of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' lying on the bottom revealed damage to the upper cover of compartment 1 's entry hatch -LRB- the lower cover of the entry hatch was opened by the personnel during evacuation -RRB- .
Ship 's Clock of the Submarine `` Komsomolets ''
This discussion of hydraulic shock is based on the practical experience of designing the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The rest of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was continuing its fight for its life during this time .
They have obviously exhausted the limit of their concern for the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , such that there was not enough left for giving three submariners a decent human burial in the ground .
Concluding my narration of the actions of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' during the accident , it would be wrong not to mention the heroic and self-sacrificing actions of certain members of the crew .
Weak combat and occupational training of the crew led to the tragic outcome of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
4 . There is no evidence that the submarine `` Komsomolets '' went to sea with a serviceable oxygen gas analyzer and with a serviceable television system .
The faulty oxygen gas analyzer in compartment 7 and the grossest violations of the rules of operating the technical resources were the most probable causes of the fire in compartment 7 . Absence of a technical crew aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' and , as a consequence of this , poor quality preparation of the ship for the cruise , were the preconditions for the accident .
The conclusion reached by the government commission in the investigation of the circumstances and causes of the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is unobjective as regards establishing the probable cause of the accident , and as regards the evaluation given to the events that led to the accident 's development and to its tragic outcome , and as a consequence of this , as regards the assessment of the fact itself of the accident and the causes bringing it about .
Looking at the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' as an isolated case , and because the members of the commission belonged to the integral military-industrial complex , the government commission was incapable of objectively and faithfully revealing the real causes of the high accident rate in the navy , and of giving this the proper assessment .
Ending our analysis of the tragedy 's development and of the actions of personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , it should be said that the author does not claim to have the absolute truth in interpreting particular events and facts .
But he is convinced of one thing : The tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was the result of its poor preparation for the cruise , and a consequence of the low combat and occupational training of the crew .
There still are numerous unanswered questions in the investigation of the circumstances of the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
About `` Deficiencies '' and `` Technical Imperfections '' : As the government commission 's work proceeded , and as the causes of the accident and the real circumstances that led to the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' became ever clearer , an extensive campaign to seek out all possible design deficiencies of the ship that had allegedly led to the tragedy was initiated in the press with the complicity of naval representatives .
In the 15 January 1990 edition of the newspaper IZVESTIYA and in the No. 2 , 1990 edition of the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK , Captain 1st Rank Kolyada used the Soviet Military Encyclopedia in an attempt to persuade everyone that the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was simply `` a vessel intended for experimentation , specially equipped and fitted out for various tests on new armament and hull structural units , and for experimental research on propulsion units , engines and other technical resources at sea. ''
The `` Komsomolets '' was not `` a vessel intended for experimentation , '' but an experimental ship -- that is , an experimental model of armament .
It was for these purposes that the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was created .
The government decree on adoption of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' by the navy was coordinated with many military leaders , including the naval commander -in- chief and the USSR minister of defense .
In this respect , contrary to Captain 1st Rank Kolyada 's opinion , the submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not require any additional certification .
All of these elementary truths should have been known to the deputy commander of the division to which the `` Komsomolets '' belonged , and people should not have been misled with fables about `` a vessel intended for experimentation. ''
From the very beginning , with assignment of the preliminary specifications in 1966 , the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was designed as an experimental ship as regards problems associated with diving depth , and as a fighting ship in all other parameters .
It has its own history , one which has no relationship to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
And so this unseemly history culminated with slander directed at the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
It reads : `` The `` Komsomolets '' was a unique submarine , and its design deficiencies were also unique in their own way .
As for `` ensuring this nuclear-powered submarine against accidents , '' the high fire and explosion safety of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was confirmed by an expert commission appointed by the navy after a hands-on inspection of its condition in the period from 11 to 20 October 1983 .
The fact that even after that deflagration occurred in compartment 5 a fire did n't start in it also attests to the fire safety of compartments of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
If the fire aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' had not been extinguished by means of this system , this system is not at fault : fire extinguisher was not delivered to the distressed compartment .
I am compelled to report , with Comrade Gorbachev in mind specifically , that the rescue chamber had been tested by the first crew of the `` Komsomolets '' during the period of experimental operation with the direct participation of representatives of the designer , the ship building plant and the navy 's search and rescue service , and that the testing involved actual separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine and its surfacing .
11 , 1990 -RRB- printed an article titled `` Did the `` Komsomolets '' Sink Accidentally ? '' by Doctor of Physicomathematical Sciences V. N. Mineyev , Candidate of Technical Sciences V. V. Korenkov and Candidate of Physicomathematical Sciences Yu .
The authors assert that `` as in Chernobyl , the disaster aboard the `` Komsomolets '' was embodied in its design. ''
They feel in this case that their main argument is the absence of obvious words such as `` reliable , '' `` unsinkable '' and `` safe '' from the supposedly official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' -- `` experimental torpedo nuclear-powered submarine . ''
Relax , comrade scientists , everything is in order with the official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Moreover there were no sudden fires in electrical equipment aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , the fuel and oil pipelines did n't crack , oxygen did n't flow into the zone of fire , fossil fuel did n't catch fire , and neither titanium , nor the powder of gas generators nor torpedo detonators burned .
To reassure you , let me give you the full official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : `` deep-sea large nuclear-powered torpedo submarine . ''
The author writes : `` The fire aboard the `` Komsomolets '' was altogether unprecedented .
How far must we go in the effort to somehow find fault with the submarine `` Komsomolets '' ? !
But at least because it was the first of its kind , as is true with all prototype ships , initially the `` Komsomolets '' needed further design improvements -- that is , it was not perfect .
Still , we should be thankful to the writer for his high assessment of the deep-sea qualities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The writer Cherkashin also has specific complaints against the design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : `` Before `` the red-hot walls of the pipelines ruptured , '' their plastic gaskets melted out , causing the release of high-pressure air into the compartment .
The conditions under which the fire burned aboard the `` Komsomolets '' had never been encountered before , and I believe they would n't be encountered if the polyamide gaskets were to be substituted by fire-refined copper . '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 59 -LSB- / -RSB-
And despite this , the conditions under which the fire burned aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' may recur , especially if the fans of `` unsoiled uniforms '' and their defenders continue to close their eyes to the bad state of combat and occupational training of submarine crews .
As for specific complaints regarding the design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , there is nothing to say -- Boyko simply did n't have any .
Fire detection equipment was foreseen aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
If it is n't , then what do we make of the command issued at 1103 to deliver fire extinguisher into compartment 7 ? Analysis of the personnel 's actions shows that throughout the entire time of the accident , the attack center of the `` Komsomolets '' was unable to really estimate the situation in the distressed compartments , to really monitor the submarine 's buoyancy and stability , and to take real steps to fight for its survival .
The detail design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed to include an LOKh firefighting system equipped with remote control from the control room .
After the new valves were developed , in 1987 the navy placed an assignment to study installation of a remote-controlled LOKh system in submarines , but for some unknown reasons a decision was made not to introduce a remote-controlled LOKh system into the `` Komsomolets '' .
As the division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada bears a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that such recommendations were not drawn up for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
During the accident the leadership of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not undertake any action to measure the parameters of the ship 's attitude or determine the elements of its buoyancy and stability , which would have made it possible to forecast the accident 's development .
Analysis of the actions taken by personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' during the accident showed that the submarine 's leadership had not given the order promptly to take the main turbogear unit -LRB- GTZA -RRB- off line , and then to seal off the bulkhead of compartment 7 .
Summarizing all of the `` design deficiencies '' of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' stated by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada , we can make the following conclusions : Not one of the indicated `` deficiencies '' could have been a cause of the accident ; these `` deficiencies '' are inherent to all or most submarines of the navy .
9 . In conclusion we need to examine the `` numerous design imperfections '' revealed in the investigation of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
But if the highly placed authors of the navy 's remarks believe that all of these `` design peculiarities '' caused the accident and demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and if they do nothing to prohibit patrol duty by submarines having such `` peculiarities , '' then what should we call them -- criminals or liars ?
The government commission left unaddressed many pieces of equipment and devices having deficiencies that were discussed in the examination of the circumstances of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : the self-contained emergency buoy failed to operate after the submarine 's demise ; the sunken submarine locator failed to operate ; the inflating system of the PSN- 20 life rafts failed to work completely , `` by the book '' ; the survival suits and diving suits are hard to use ; the face masks of the IDA-59 apparatus are uncomfortable and unreliable .
Now a few words about measures to increase fire protection to submarines and exclude accidents aboard them , developed on the basis of the results of examining the circumstances of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and accepted for implementation .
In August 1990 the USSR Council of Ministers published a decree on the results of the examination of the circumstances behind the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , drafted by the naval leadership .
`` Design Peculiarities '' of the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' : Looking over the list of the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair , `` Submarine Design Peculiarities Influencing , in the Navy 's Opinion , the Advent and Development of Large and Fast- Developing Fires and Hindering Ship Damage Control , '' we can make the following conclusions .
There were 49 alternating current distribution panels , nine direct current distribution panels , four alternating current main distribution panels and one direct current main distribution panel -- that is , 63 distribution panels -- within the electric power system of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Such placement of panels is characteristic of all of the navy 's submarines , and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The oil reserve 's location in the aft compartment is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
As for the overall amount of equipment , compartment 7 aboard the `` Komsomolets '' has less than any of the others .
There are significantly fewer such openings aboard the `` Komsomolets '' than in other submarines of the navy .
In particular there are 53 openings in the pressure hull in the aft compartment of a certain third-generation submarine with a compartment 7 of the same size as that in the `` Komsomolets '' .
There were only 38 openings in the pressure hull in compartment 7 of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
4 . The assertion of the authors of the remark that the distribution panels aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' are not protected from the influence of oil vapor is inconsistent with reality .
This system for removing oil vapor from air is also used aboard other submarines of the navy , and the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique in this .
In all of the time that the `` Komsomolets '' was in operation , not a single case of oil getting on equipment in any compartment was documented .
The detail design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' had already been approved by this time -LRB- 1972 -RRB- , and the shop drawings were practically finished .
The submarine `` Komsomolets '' was designed in accordance with specifications approved in 1966 , and the TPPL-67 submarine design requirements , developed by the navy .
11.4.26 of the TPPL-75 were satisfied in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , with the exception of requirements on using KMZh cable in emergency electric power networks .
The `` consequences '' of imagined peculiarities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' dreamed up by the authors are also inconsistent with reality .
The shafting of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is designed in full correspondence with Article X-75 of the TPPL-67 , which contains no requirement regarding the airtightness of bulkheads when shafting is operating at elevated pressure , as is asserted by the authors of the remark .
As far as the essence of the issue is concerned , the bulkhead between compartments 6 and 7 is airtight aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' when the shafting is operating under normal conditions and at elevated pressure -LRB- within normal conditions -RRB- .
However , the RBITS never was written by the Naval Institute No. 1 , and the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair did not plan or support its development for the `` Komsomolets '' in time .
The detail design for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was drawn up with an LOKh system that could be started remotely from the attack center in accordance with requirements of the specifications and the TPPL- 67 .
Later on , citing insufficient reliability of remotely controlled electromagnetic valves , decision No. S- 13/002834 , 17 October 1975 , of the USSR Ministry of Ship Building Industry and the navy prescribed replacement of these valves aboard all submarines by manually controlled fittings , which is what was done on the `` Komsomolets '' .
A manually started LOKh system is used on most submarines , and therefore the assertion of the authors of the remark that this was a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
In this case for unknown reasons the navy decided not to install the system in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and it did not foresee completion of these developments for this ship .
It is consequently wrong for the navy to lodge any complaints about the absence of a remotely started LOKh system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The LOKh system in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed in full correspondence with naval requirements OTT MO 6.1.17-79 ,
2 . None of the navy 's submarines has containers with a freon reserve , and this is also not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
4 . The instructions on operating the LOKh system were developed for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in accordance with standard instructions coordinated with the navy , which say nothing about the fire extinguishing characteristics of freon .
Consequently any discussion of the absence of these resources aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is pointless and totally meaningless .
Such protection is absent from all submarines of the navy that have the `` Korund '' system , such that this is also not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
2 . Analysis of the interrogation of the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' by the government commission shows that the `` Korund '' caught fire not in the vicinity of the sunchro circuits but in the power supply units of the `` Korund '' located inside the stand of the `` Vektor '' subsystem .
In light of the above , the so-called `` consequences '' of the imagined peculiarities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' have no real basis .
do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
The electric power systems of all submarines of the navy are built on the basis of this principle , such that this is not a peculiarity of just the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The cables in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' were not disconnected not because it was a major emergency situation , as the authors of the remark assert , but only because the personnel did not know what had to be disconnected due to the absence of the RBITS , and because they never practiced this operation in ship damage control training .
Most submarines of the navy are made with the kingstonless design , and this is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
2 . The TPPL-67 , in accordance with which the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was designed , does not contain a requirement of mandatory installation of kingston valves in main ballast tanks .
For the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 , the requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
At the time of the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' the sea state was around 2 - 3 points , and its influence upon the ship 's buoyancy reserve was negligible .
The high-pressure air system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was built in accordance with OST V5.5017-79 , and it is similar in its structure to the same systems of other submarines of the navy .
The assertion of the authors of the remark that this system is unique to the `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
The `` consequences '' formulated by the authors of the remark are deliberately misleading : the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' made no attempts during the accident to blow the main ballast tanks with air from cofferdam No. 2 of the high-pressure air system through the outside air main because of their poor knowledge of the ship 's material ; main ballast tanks can be blown with outboard air from high- pressure air cofferdam No. 2 by way of a special main connecting the No. 1 and 2 high-pressure air cofferdams .
All of the discussion concerning absence of these automated systems and instruments aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' are directed at consciously and deliberately misleading public opinion .
do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities , '' and any reference to them is wrong .
As for the `` consequences , '' the following needs to be said : The attack center of the `` Komsomolets '' did nothing to study the objective information on the course of events in the accident situation .
The authors of the remark are concerned not with clarifying the true causes of the tragedy but only with finding plausible `` evidence '' in order to conceal and justify the poor occupational training of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , which is the sole cause of the tragedy .
Such that its absence from the `` Komsomolets '' is not a peculiarity of this submarine .
3 . RAVA hoses are used aboard all submarines built in recent years , and their use aboard the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique to this submarine .
The assertion that the reliability of electric power equipment in systems in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is low is not justified by anything , and is inconsistent with reality .
All of this made it possible to guarantee high comprehensive reliability indicators in the specifications on the submarine `` Komsomolets '' ; the high comprehensive indicators of the reliability of the systems , equipment and the ship as a whole were confirmed by bench tests on experimental models of new equipment , which included testing for failure-free operation of this equipment throughout the entire time of continuous operation established by the specifications , and experimental operation of the submarine on the basis of a special program , to include a fully independent cruise .
The designer drew up the following basic documents on the reliability of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : design reliability justification K-020-556 ; specific features of base support K-020-073 ; equipment reliability indicators K-030-640 ; technical crew calculations and justification K-030-631 ; recommendations for developing the RBITS 21.GGK-E-478-82 ; in accordance with the standard program for supporting submarine reliability No. 004-65-013 , the navy should have developed a specific program , with the designer 's participation , to support reliability during operation of the `` Komsomolets '' .
About the `` consequences '' : Leaving aside the thoughts of the authors of the remark regarding electrical equipment of second-generation submarines as being irrelevant to the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , we need to say that in 5 years of operation of the `` Komsomolets '' , no negative remarks were ever made regarding the work of series AM and AM-M circuit breakers .
The navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair failed to carry out the following basic measures to support high reliability of technical resources during operation of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : A reliability support program was not created ; a set of repair documents for planned preventive inspections and repairs to be carried out between cruises was not developed ; basing of the submarine in accordance with requirements of document K-020-073 was not provided for ; a technical crew was not organized for the submarine ; the operating cycle governing use of the submarine foreseen by the specifications was not maintained , as a result of which the ship set off on its cruise with part of the life of the equipment and systems expended -LRB- automatic systems , outboard fittings , gas analyzers -RRB- .
In light of the above , the thoughts of the authors of the remark regarding the absence of any kind of `` program , '' which made it impossible to maintain `` high reliability of technical resources '' aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , are devoid of any grounds .
Materials corresponding to OST V5.9025-80 and the `` Statute on Selection of Nonmetallic Structural Materials for Submarines '' No. 74 - 0450 - 06-78 were used to trim compartments of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , including compartment 7 .
They are used to trim the compartments of all submarines of the navy , such that this is not a peculiarity of the `` Komsomolets '' .
these requirements do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
This requirement was satisfied to a realistic extent aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The stationary breathing system -LRB- SDS -RRB- of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed in full correspondence with guidelines RD V5.5536-82 ,
Such systems were developed for all submarines according to the same principle , and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The requirements of Article VII-7 of the TPPL-67 are satisfied in their full volume in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
According to the detail design the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' should have consisted of 41 persons , in which case the number of personnel in BCh-5 should have been 19 officers and warrant officers .
2 . The submarine `` Komsomolets '' set off on its cruise without the full complement of personnel in the damage control division of BCh- 5 -LRB- Warrant Officer Yu .
About the `` consequences '' : Analysis of damage control efforts aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' shows that : 1 .
The `` Listvennitsa '' loudspeaker communication system -LRB- GGS -RRB- is installed aboard all submarines of the navy , in connection with which this is not a peculiarity of only the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Not a single submarine of the navy has such a system , and therefore its absence from the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique to the ship .
These recommendations were obviously not drawn up , and they were not studied by the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' during submarine damage control exercises .
The air systems of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' do not differ from the systems of other third-generation submarines , and they are in no way `` unique. ''
do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in paragraph 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
concerning system back-up were fully realized in the `` Komsomolets '' , while the requirements of Article 1.3.3.1 of the OTT6 .1.1 - 81
The above assertions of the authors of the remark are aimed at covering up the incorrect actions of the attack center of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The emergency pumping system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was built in accordance with the OST , and it did not differ in any way from similar systems aboard other submarines .
The assertion of the authors of the remark that the design of the emergency pumping system is a `` peculiarity '' of the `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
2 . The requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
Aboard the `` Komsomolets '' , these valves had manual and hydraulic drives .
The `` consequences '' have the goal of covering up the inaction of the attack center of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in containing the accident and fighting for the ship 's survival .
They returned me once again to the question of the roots of the tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
The tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' occurred 33 years later , and once again for the same reasons .
`` Listvennitsa '' -- code name given to the internal ship loudspeaker communication system installed aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Here and subsequently , pressures are indicated in the values of a technical system of units -LRB- the meter-kilogram -force -second system of units -RRB- , because all pressure measuring instruments aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' were graduated on the basis of this system .
The TsVK room aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is located in compartment 3 , next to the control room .
Aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' it was intended for the rescue of all personnel from a depth exceeding the submarine 's maximum diving depth .
The submarine `` Komsomolets '' had only an emergency reserve of regenerating cartridges .
The Komsomolets could dive to 1,000 meters , whereas an ordinary submarine could only go as far as 400 to 600 meters .
The Komsomolets was to have destroyed missile-armed submarines and carrier strike groups composed of aircraft carriers and escort ships , and it could also direct long-range fire against onshore targets ... .
However , the Komsomolets was in fact unable to serve the Motherland .
Others insisted on dismembering the Komsomolets with a view to coaxing each part out of the watery depths separately .
Another very simple method would be to latch onto the Komsomolets with a kind of lasso and tow it toward the shore ... .
The aim was to establish the real reason for the wreck of the Komsomolets and to remove the torpedoes with nuclear charges .
The Komsomolets is lying level on an even keel .
For the first time our specialists were able to go inside the Komsomolets using remote-control robots .
Robots the size of large vacuum cleaners entered the Komsomolets through gaps in the hull and two open portholes .
While the Komsomolets was ablaze on the surface , military pilots photographed it from the air .
This is why specialists have started to look for a way of neutralizing the Komsomolets that avoids having to bring it to the surface .
But calculations have shown that on soft ground with a density of just 1.8 , the Komsomolets could break up .
This summer a new expedition will set off for the sunken Komsomolets .
The operation to construct the sarcophagus at the site of the accident and the wreck of the nuclear submarine Komsomolets is slated to take two months .
The Komsomolets was fitted with everything that was the last word in submarine building .
Having completed their tasks on the Komsomolets , the researchers made their way to the Kara Sea where , using the same instruments , they took ecological measurements in areas where nuclear waste and nuclear reactors from submarines had been dumped .

Corrosion is going at a high rate in the Komsomolets nuclear submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea , Tengiz Borisov , chairman of the Russian government 's Underwater Works Commission , said at a news conference in Moscow Wednesday .
Komsomolets was the third Soviet submarine that sank as a result of a technical failure .
Borisov said that plans were about to be finalized to seal the torpedo compartment of Komsomolets .
Samples of sea water and of the sea bed in the vicinity of where the nuclear submarine Komsomolets sank in the Norwegian Sea showed that radiation levels there stayed within normal background values over 10 recent days , the Russian Navy press office reported .
The Northern Fleet Press Office emphasized that radiation was continuously monitored in the area where Komsomolets had sunk .
Today 's Moscow press singles out reports on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea as a result of a fire five years ago .
In this connection , the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper , taking into account that the komsomolets was not decontaminated due to incompetence of people responsible for this case , calls on Russian authorities to take urgent measures to prevent a possible radiation disaster in the region of the submarine 's wreckage .
Pyzh added that the Northern Fleet command wanted reports and forecasts on what was going on or would happen where Komsomolets had sunk to be based on specific tests and accurate data .
They are to seal off the submarine 's front section , conduct technical tests on the vessel and check its inflated safe chamber , lying on the sea bed six kilometers from Komsomolets .
The Deputy Director of the Federal Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 Stepan Kravchenko disclosed at the meeting that a new device would be installed on board Komsomolets to detect uranium and plutonium carrying weapons .
As a deputy minister Sergey Khetagurov has told Interfax , yet another expedition to the Norwegian sea is planned next year to carry out the second stage of the sealing operation to make Komsomolets complete safe .
the Nuclear Submarine ` Komsomolets '
KOPRON 's experts have arrived at a final conclusion : It is dangerous to salvage the `` Komsomolets `` and therefore it is necessary to build a special sarcophagus from the submarine 's hull , having sealed the submarine 's nose section and torpedo tubes using a special compound -LRB- development of the compound is continuing -RRB- .
The board of directors of the Russian ministry for emergency situations -LSB- Ministry for Civil Defense , Emergencies , and Natural Disasters -RSB- has held an open session to report on preparing an expedition to the Norwegian Sea , where the Komsomolets nuclear- powered submarine sank in deep waters .
Therefore , a decision was taken in Moscow to carry on rescue works at the site of the Komsomolets wreckage this summer .
`` KOMSOMOLETS ' Nuclear Submarine Safety Supervised by MChS
Radiation Disaster in Norwegian Sea Is Almost Inevitable ; Departmental Muddle Causing Country To Lose Last Chance To Make Nuclear-Powered Submarine Komsomolets Safe
In a few days , on April 7 , it will be exactly five years since the loss of the submarine Komsomolets and 42 of its crewmen in the Norwegian Sea .
And this can easily be explained : In the time since the Komsomolets went down , Russians have witnessed a sizable number of disasters and accidents .
A brief surge in attention to the Komsomolets problem occurred in September 1993 , when the fourth expedition to study the site where the submarine sunk returned from the Norwegian Sea .
Using the Mir-1 and Mir-2 deep-sea units , it was able to ascertain that the casings of two of the Komsomolets 's nuclear torpedoes had been almost completely eaten away by rust and that they would leak plutonium far more quickly that had been expected .
Despite such bleak forecasts , however , the specialists studying the Komsomolets problem were confident that a radiation disaster could nonetheless be prevented .
In addition , CSUO chief Tengiz Borisov managed to do the almost impossible : Financing for all operations involving the Komsomolets was included in the state order .
And these two `` natural calamities '' have posed an insurmountable obstacle to solving the Komsomolets problem .
In early 1994 the plan for sealing the Komsomolets was approved by a session of the Security Council 's interdepartmental commission on environmental safety -LRB- better known as Aleksey Yablokov 's commission -RRB- and forwarded to the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection for expert environmental review .
Instead of assessing the environmental danger or , on the contrary , the dangers of the sealing project , the council 's members opened a new discussion of the operation 's expediency per se and other possible options for rendering the Komsomolets harmless .
And while one can still understand the unhurried actions of the Ministry of Environmental Protection , the position of the department that now bears full responsibility for the Komsomolets 's fate seems inexplicable , at first glance .
Sergey Khetagurov , former chairman of the North Ossetian Council of Ministers , who switched chairs to become deputy minister for emergencies , has been put in charge of all measures relating to the Komsomolets .
On the other hand , three months after the creation of the ministry administration in charge of the Komsomolets problem , it has just one member -- Reserve Rear Admiral Mikhail Tolokonnikov , former deputy chief of the old CSUO .
If the expedition to the Komsomolets collapses , ministry officials will be able to blame the mistakes and muddling within their own ministry on seemingly objective difficulties caused by the delay in obtaining expert environmental review and the lack of financing .
Meanwhile , the problem of making the Komsomolets safe has taken on a new , international aspect .
One such organization is the Komsomolets Memorial Foundation , which was created in Holland and has announced to the entire world that it is raising funds to raise the submarine .
To properly assess this amount , it must be said that Russia itself spent an incomparably greater sum -- $ 4 million and 1 billion rubles -- on operations relating to the Komsomolets in that same year alone .
Provision of the funds -- which , incidentally , the Dutch government , not the foundation itself , intends to provide as aid to Russia -- is contingent on a number of conditions , chief of which is that the Dutch firms Smith and Heerem -LSB- Kheyerem -RSB- be hired as the main contractors in operations involving the Komsomolets .
In the summer of 1995 , there will be an underwater Chernobyl at the Komsomolets site : By that time the submarine 's torpedoes will be destroyed completely , and no one and nothing will be able to stop plutonium-239 from leaking out .
In addition , rather large suspended radioactive particles that can be transported by currents were found at the Komsomolets site in August 1993 .
He reports that , despite the real possibility of a volley discharge of weapons-grade plutonium into the marine environment from the sunken Komsomolets , the expedition to it and the actual sealing of the vessel are in jeopardy .
Why does the situation with regard to the sunken Komsomolets elicit such increased attention and such contradictory assessments ?
The question of ensuring the Komsomolets ' radiation safety is far more serious than other similar tragic instances .
Some of them -- mainly employees of the Ministry for Emergency Situations -- maintain that fishing is not conducted at a depth of 1,700 meters , where the Komsomolets lies , and so there is simply no threat that plutonium will get into the fish diet and thence onto people 's tables .
The academicians believe that it would be premature to conclude that in work with the nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets it is possible to confine ourselves just to radiation monitoring ; everything must be done to make naval weapons systems safe , bearing the possibility of accidents in mind .
The people who last year organized and carried out the unique deep-water experiment in the Norwegian Sea , who ascertained and analyzed the actual condition of the sunken vessel and its systems , and who used unique underwater robots to peep inside the Komsomolets , proposed their own program for corrosion-proofing it -- packing the torpedo compartment with a special sorbent , isolating it from seabed currents by means of metal covers with rubber seals , and , in addition , giving the Ministry for Emergency Situations disinterested assistance in implementing it and working on the expedition on a voluntary basis .
Nursultan Nazarbayev , who is , perhaps , the strongest politician among CIS presidents , proved to the Kremlin these months which are far from being a honeymoon , that it is necessary for Russian to reckon with him .
`` However , no other country in the world should be more interested in a strong and stable Kazakhstan than Russia , since the newly-independent state has become the most reliable buffer between Russian and explosive Central Asia .
B. Suprunyuk , leader of the Russian Community of Northern Kazakhstan , and V. Latynin , ataman -LRB- chieftain -RRB- of the Moscow branch of the Cossack Union , handed over a message , addressed to the presidents of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan , to the embassy .
Kazakhstan is the world 's only country where the activities of the Russian community , Cossack and Slavic associations are banned juridically . ''
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian First Lady Naina Yeltsin who said , in particular : `` Reading newspapers , one gathers the impression that Boris Nikolayevich -LSB- Yeltsin -RSB- does not want people to live a better and easier life .
`` In the event of multiple discharges of plutonium from the sunken submarine 's nuclear missiles -- such discharges may continue for several years -- strong underwater currents , which in the area reach a speed of 1.5 metre per second and which change their course several times a day , would lead to a rapid contamination of several thousand square kilometres of the seabed .
Considering that plutonium 's period of semi-decay is 24,000 years , the sea in that sector would turn out to be unfit for fisheries over a span of 600 -700 years '' .
However , as has become known , thanks to research carried out by Russian shore-based scientists , the reactor does not pose a serious ecological threat .
The aim of the latest expedition by the Committee for Conducting Special Purpose Submarine Work -LSB- KOPRON -RSB- -- which has kindly given our program exclusive rights to show its video material -- was to assess the situation concerning the warheads .
If plutonium escapes into the sea it could cause serious ecological danger .
His opinion regarding the causes of the accident and demise of the submarine , which is based on documented testimony , contradicts the conclusions reached by the government commission .
In the course of the commission 's work , members of its working group from ship building industry who directly participated in the submarine 's construction -- chief delivery agent V. M. Chuvakin , delivery mechanic E. P. Leonov and assistant chief designer D. A. Romanov -- arrived at a special opinion regarding the causes of the accident and the demise of the submarine that differed from the opinion of other members of the working group representing the navy .
This compelled us to write a letter to the chairman of the government commission , CPSU Central Committee Secretary O. D. Baklanov , but even after this , the opinion of the naval engineers influenced the official conclusion of the government commission regarding the causes of the accident and demise of the submarine to only a most insignificant degree .
Let 's listen to the opinion of workers of the Main Naval Staff : `` As far as causes bringing about the accident are concerned , numerous technical imperfections in the submarine 's various systems should be named first .
And he concluded : `` Despite the self-sacrificing and technically competent actions by the personnel , it was impossible to save the submarine . ''
Nuclear-powered attack submarines are the most complex , potentially dangerous and vulnerable objects in this respect .
It is the professionalism of the crew that actually influences the situation and events in a submarine 's compartments before and during an accident , prevents or , in the opposite case , promotes the advent and development of an accident situation , and determines the effectiveness of the personnel 's actions in recovering from the accident .
`` After its commissioning , the submarine underwent experimental operation for several years .
The submarine crews gave a high evaluation to its operating properties on the basis of their navigation experience. '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 4 -LSB- / -RSB-
A. Vanin 's crew was the second crew of this submarine , and the cruise that began on 28 February 1989 and ended in the tragedy of 7 April was its first independent cruise .
While giving credit to the heroism and bravery of the crewmembers , we need to objectively evaluate their actions during the accident , so as not to allow repetition of such cases in the future due to wrong and biased conclusions based only on real and imaginary imperfections of a submarine .
We will also examine the `` numerous technical imperfections '' supposedly present in this submarine , which in the opinion of the naval leadership helped to bring about the accident .
According to the manning table approved in 1982 by the General Staff of the USSR Ministry of Defense , the submarine 's crew was 57 persons -LRB- 29 officers with rank not below senior lieutenant , 26 warrant officer technicians and two compulsory-service petty officers -RRB- .
In what matter were the circumstances of the submarine accident investigated ?
The working group has a tape recording of the interrogation of submarine personnel by members of the government commission , the explanatory reports of the surviving members of the crew , extracts from the ship 's log and extracts from the control log of the main propulsion unit .
From the very beginning , naval representatives did everything to prove that the submarine was prepared well for the cruise , that the personnel were excellently trained , and that the actions of the ship 's attack center and the leadership of the Northern Fleet were the right ones , and if the submarine sank and the greater part of the crew perished , this was at the fault of the designer and industrial workers .
An extensive campaign to publicize the `` competent '' actions of the crew , begun in the press under the leadership of the fleet command long before the initial conclusions were reached by the government commission , was also directed at concealing serious shortcomings associated with manning and training the crews , with servicing the submarine and with solving social problems .
In 1988 the crew underwent retraining at the training center , and in September it was certified with an unsatisfactory score in ship damage control -LRB- a letter from submarine commanders of the Northern Fleet 's First Flotilla sent in August 1989 to CPSU Central Committee Secretary O. D. Baklanov -RRB- .
In the letter mentioned above from the submarine commanders , it is asserted that the crew had corrected the shortcomings revealed in work on damage control problems , and completed them with a good grade .
In early January 1989 a conflict occurred in the crew during the submarine 's preparation for patrol duty .
It involved the crew 's work on ship damage control problems , it was examined at an emergency party meeting , -LSB- . sup -RSB- 12 -LSB- / -RSB- and it ended in the hospital for Captain 3d Rank A. S. Ternovskiy , the submarine deputy commander for political affairs .
In this case eight of the officers were lieutenants -- that is , 25 percent of the officers had served aboard a submarine for about a year after graduating from school , and their rank -LRB- and consequently their level of occupational training -RRB- did not correspond to the approved table .
And thus the requirements of the `` Manual of Submarine Damage Control '' -LRB- RBZh-PL-82 -RRB- were violated .
RBZh-PL-82 , Article 173 : `` Departure for sea is prohibited ... when
Due to objective causes the submarine crew could not have possessed high professional skill and experience in operating the material , which ultimately affected the outcome of the crew 's fight for the submarine 's survival .
How are submarine crews trained in training centers ?
The quality of the training is extremely unsatisfactory , because it is carried out sporadically , with emphasis on theory , without relevance to a particular submarine , especially when it comes to carrying out general damage control exercises aboard ship .
The navy also lacks a system of occupational selection of submarine crewmembers on the basis of psychological stability in extreme situations .
Does he really feel that a combat patrol by a submarine under fully self-contained conditions is any less complex and dangerous a mission than a flight into space ?
Submarine crews are perpetually diverted from combat training for garrison duty , for housekeeping work and for other incidental duties , and this occurs both during construction and testing of a submarine and during patrol duty .
And because submarines are provided an unsatisfactory supply of electric power and working power production units , it is impossible to organize high quality crew training aboard the submarine itself .
The prestige of serving aboard nuclear-powered submarines dropped dramatically in the last two decades because such service involved continual relocations , absence of housing , the unsettled daily life of the families of submariners , and the difficulty of the work itself .
The entire burden of this work is laid upon the submarine crews .
But in reality submarine crews are physically unable to carry out the full volume of routine maintenance and inspection with acceptable quality within the 40 days allowed to them .
The submarine fleet has even evolved a system of `` failure to failure '' equipment operation .
Moreover the difficulties of routine maintenance and inspection aboard this submarine were aggravated by the absence of a set of documents concerning refits between cruises .
None of these issues were reflected in the materials of the government commission , which is fully natural at least because Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev , who as the chief of the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair was responsible for the unsatisfactory equipment of submarine bases and the quality of repairs and routine maintenance and inspection , was appointed chairman of the `` Operation and Damage Control '' section of this commission 's working group .
This proposal was shamelessly distorted in the 8 August 1989 edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA , in which the need for company service was explained by the low quality of submarine construction .
Let 's turn to the joint act of the two sections , mentioned above : `` The sensor of the MN- 5134 automatic oxygen gas analyzer of compartment 7 failed on the 10th day of the cruise , '' and `` The television system failed during the navigation period prior to the submarine 's accident. ''
There are full grounds for suggesting that the submarine set out on its cruise with a faulty gas analyzer and a faulty television system .
It follows from this reply that the submarine went to sea with a faulty system of batch blowing of ballast tanks .
Review of video tape showing the location at which this camera is secured permits a categorical conclusion -- the television camera had been removed from the submarine at the base , prior to its cruise .
RBZh-PL-82 , Article 173 : `` Departure for sea is prohibited ... in
It is difficult to say how much a working television system could have helped the submarine 's attack center to correctly estimate the situation in compartment 7 and adopt the necessary damage control decisions , but one thing is clear -- there is no doubt that its breakdown played a negative role .
But to satisfy its own internal plans the command of the Northern Fleet tasked the submarine for ordinary patrol duty , which could have been carried out by any of dozens of other submarines in the fleet .
mission posed for this patrol duty -LRB- That is , the submarine 's last cruise. -- D.R. -RRB- was to carry out scientific research together with hydrographic research vessels from 14 April to the end of May 1989 . ''
Seven April 1989 rolled around .
The submarine was traveling at a depth of 386 meters at a speed of 8 knots , if we are to believe the ship 's log , while if we believe what was said by division deputy commander B. G. Kolyada and remote control division commander Captain Lieutenant I. S. Orlov when they were interrogated by the government commission , at a speed of 6 knots .
The submarine command is fighting this attitude toward duty , but without results as yet .
Ask your sons , husbands , fathers and brothers how they managed to get to a point in their lives where submarine designers are compelled to create an `` electronic cattle prod '' to force the submariner to do something upon which his life and the welfare of his relatives and family depend .
So what are we told by the entries in the ship 's log for 7 April 1989 from midnight to the time when the command `` Deliver LOKh to compartment 7 ! '' resounded like a shot ?
The lack of information regarding the submarine 's operation was already discussed .
However , as a rule submarine crews do not make a practice of using this system in their day-to-day activities , and they do not use it at times of accidents .
He reported to me that the submarine had been inspected , without remarks , somewhere around 1100 .
Kolyada 's entire interview , beginning with incompetent notions regarding an `` experimental vessel '' and ending with the shameful assertions that the crew had dealt with the fire with minimum sacrifices -LRB- apparently the demise of a submarine and 42 crewmembers is a minimum sacrifice ! -RRB- , was false and unobjective .
This logical conclusion is reinforced by entries in the ship 's log and the testimony of surviving members of the submarine crew .
There was but one goal -- to justify the delay and the incompetent actions of the submarine 's leadership in the initial period of the accident , and to prove that it was impossible to save the ship , and that the crew could not have taken any more- radical actions in the fight for the submarine 's survival .
The joint order cited above states that `` a fire in electrical equipment of the rudder hydraulic system pump starting station or in the oil separation system due to maladjustment of controlling devices and this equipment 's safety system was the possible primary cause of the submarine 's disaster. ''
But in the government commission 's report there is absolutely no mention of oxygen as one of the possible causes of the tragedy that occurred aboard the submarine .
In real conditions , work of the starting station of the hydraulic system pump aboard the submarine in `` bell '' mode would have been noticed by the operator at the `` Molibden '' console , and the faulty pump would have been disconnected with no consequences to the compartment .
However , the oil separation system was disconnected early in the morning on 7 April , and it was not working before the accident .
And in order to end the analysis of these versions , we turn the floor over to Captain 1st Rank Kolyada -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` A telegram reporting an accident aboard the submarine `` B-354 '' -- a distribution panel catching fire -- was received on the fourth -LRB- The reference is to 4 April 1989 , 3 days before the accident. -- D.R. -RRB- .
Let 's believe Kolyada in this matter , all the more so because there is not even a hint in all of his statements to the press that the submarine 's electrical equipment may have been the cause of the fire .
None of this was done aboard the submarine .
Because of this , it was impossible to begin venting compartment 3 in time , and for a long time the control room personnel were forced to wear ShDA apparatus , which made submarine damage control difficult .
Concluding our examination of this issue , we should say that after the fire in the `` Korund '' console was put out , the attack center did not transmit the command `` All clear from the damage control alarm `` Fire in compartment 3 ! '' , '' and it did not order delivery of power to distribution panels RShchN No. 7 and 6 , which was another mistake by the submarine 's leadership .
Pressure began to rise in compartment 5 . Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev -LRB- supplement to explanatory report -RRB- : `` Monitoring air pressure in the submarine 's compartments , at the moment the fire began at the `` Korund '' control console I noticed an insignificant rise in pressure in compartment 5 , on the order of 0.5 kg /cm -LSB- . sup -RSB- 2 -LSB- / -RSB- . ''
From this moment on , the submarine would be left without electronic observation resources .
The command was given to deenergize the `` Sinus '' -- the power supply system of the submarine 's automatic equipment control system .
When the `` Sinus '' system is deenergized , remote control and monitoring of all of the submarine 's technical resources is lost , with the exception of the reactor 's emergency shielding and certain especially important ship systems supporting ship damage control efforts -LRB- such as the emergency main ballast tank blowing system -RRB- .
We do n't know if other fire extinguishers were used as well , but one thing is clear -- it can not be said that the quality of the submarine crew 's preparation for the cruise was high .
Lining plates began separating away from the right side of the submarine 's outer hull , in the vicinity of main ballast tank No. 10 , which was noted by Captain Lieutenant Verezgov .
Still , the submarine command did apparently receive the report of a deflagration in compartment 5 . Was information on the fire in compartment 5 reflected in the actions of the submarine command ?
These entries in the ship 's log are nothing other than a reaction by the submarine command to the report they received of a deflagration in compartment 5 .
It is necessary to go on at such length about all of this simply because the naval members of the government commission 's working group , who ignored the facts , insisted upon the legend of a `` fully involved fire '' from the very beginning of the accident , and asserted that the VPL system had been discharged by personnel of compartment 5 .
When the main ballast tanks are damaged but water does not enter the pressure hull of a surfaced submarine , right the submarine in accordance with documents on keeping a damaged submarine afloat and the RBITS , and monitor the submarine 's attitude more closely , blowing as necessary the undamaged main ballast tanks not equipped with kingston valves as they fill.
The submarine 's attitude was not monitored during the entire accident .
The submarine command did not even try to determine the reason for the increasing list .
Under these conditions the submarine 's leadership apparently decided to start up the electric supply fan of the forward ring of the ship ventilation system , and gave the command to open the outer clack valve on the ventilation supply line .
Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev : `` When the submarine surfaced , it was listing to port .
First of all , a list of even 8ë is not dangerous from the standpoint of maintaining the submarine 's transverse equilibrium , and sacrificing buoyancy reserve on it is highly unsuitable .
Second , before the submarine 's list was corrected , the reason for it should have been clarified , which was not done .
This would have made it possible not only to correct the list but also to trim the submarine .
The main danger to a submarine is the loss not of transverse but of longitudinal equilibrium .
Such that on the whole , the decision of the submarine command to flood the right main ballast tank No. 5 was incompetent .
Prior to the accident the submarine was at a depth of 386 meters .
During emergency surfacing , in all probability `` Molibden '' console operator Lieutenant Zaytsev did not connect the tank to the high-pressure air blowing line , and the submarine surfaced with main ballast tank No. 5 unblown .
However , there is one other side of the problem regarding the designer 's mistake : Had the first and second crews of the submarine practiced damage control problems well , this design error would have been revealed right away , and corrected .
The submarine command designated new lines of defense .
In this particular situation of inactivity , forcing reduction of pressure in compartments 6 and 7 would have led to the earlier demise of the submarine .
As was said earlier , the pressure was bled into other compartments of the submarine through the oxygen dispensing and carbon dioxide removing lines of the air regenerating system , through the air line of the trim system , through the high-pressure air fitting remote control pipeline , through the drain line of the hydraulic system , and through the system of seals on the TTsNA turbopump unit .
The operator of the main propulsion unit console had not closed the kingston valve of the cooling system of the stern-tube gland -LRB- when reactor power is limited to 30 percent , the cooling system does not influence the submarine 's power , and in accordance with Article 91 of the RBZh- PL-82 it should have been inactivated without orders -RRB- .
After fulfilling the command of the attack center to close the high-pressure air subgroup valves , the submarine was left without air , and for practical purposes without damage control resources .
Warrant Officer A. P. Kozhanov -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` You could hear the ballast being blown , and we realized that the submarine had surfaced -LRB- we understood this from the depth gauge and from the rocking -RRB- , after that the whistling of air could be heard for some time longer , after which we could see from the pressure gauges that high-pressure air cofferdams 1 , 3 and 4 were completely discharged .
The attack center had to know this , and when it gave the order to shut the high-pressure air subgroup valves , the submarine 's leadership was cutting off , in the direct meaning of this word , oxygen to people connected to ShDA apparatus .
The cause of the submarine 's listing to port seemed completely clear , there were no problems with main ballast tank No. 5 , the sources of smoke entering compartments 2 and 3 were determined and shut , steps were taken to replenish the high- pressure air reserves , the cause of the pressure drop in the distressed compartments had been clarified , the draft , trim and longitudinal stability of the submarine had been determined , the damage control plan was ready , and all tasks facing the damage control division commander regarding the accident , as prescribed to him by Article 45 of the RBZh-PL-82 , had been carried out .
Obviously this was the sole person in the crew who knew the submarine well .
It would not be long before the submarine would find itself without electric power , and consequently without communication with the outside world .
Practically the entire reserve of high-pressure air -- the principal means of damage control and of maintaining the submarine 's stability -- was gone .
Had it been transmitted at this time , the tender `` Aleksey Khlobystov '' could have reached the site of the accident before the submarine 's demise , and most of the crew would have been saved .
But the submarine 's leadership apparently did not have enough courage to adopt an untraditional decision , and radio the distress signal in uncoded text .
For such initiative , the submarine command would have received harsh treatment , despite the fact that there 's no official prohibition on transmitting an SOS .
The submarine had a single free exit up through the hatch of the rescue chamber .
Apparently the submarine 's leadership itself came to understand the absurdity of this undertaking .
Captain Lieutenant Speranskiy used a hydroelectric manipulator to close the bulkhead clack valves , and Warrant Officer Kozhanov began preparing the ShDA apparatus and deenergized electrical equipment not affecting the submarine 's power and control. ''
Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` The submarine commander gave orders to measure the CO concentration in the compartment .
What was the estimate of the accident situation during this period by the submarine 's leadership ?
Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` According to the BCh-5 commander 's calculations , in the worst-case scenario -- flooding of the aft compartments -- the submarine would lose stability by 1500 .
Nothing was known about how things stood with evacuation of people , but at this time the submarine commander gave orders to evacuate secret business documents , which was documented in the ship 's log .
Later on Captain 1st Rank Kolyada talked long and often about the submarine 's demise being a surprise to the crew , which is why the personnel were unable to make full use of rescue resources .
And as we can see , all of the entries in the ship 's log regarding VVD-200 confirm in writing the submarine personnel 's poor knowledge of its material .
It should be noted in this case that the submarine command , which knew that there were still two people connected up to ShDA apparatus in compartment 5 , was unable to organize a larger damage control party for simultaneous evacuation of the victims .
Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : '' Then we turned on the diesel engine and exhaust fans -- air began flowing into the submarine . ''
Accelerated cooling of the submarine 's nuclear reactor by way of the battery-less cooling system -LRB- the BBR system -RRB- was proceeding with forced circulation of water in loop 1 by the loop 1 circulating pumps -LRB- TsNPK -RRB- .
The automatic system and equipment of the reactor compartment activated the emergency shielding , managed the reactor 's steady cooling and monitored all of its parameters until the submarine went down .
There are full grounds for believing that the submarine command was unable to man large damage control parties .
What was happening at this time in the submarine ?
Luckily it was impossible to carry it out -- otherwise the submarine may have sunk an hour earlier , and no one would have been saved .
Nor were any attempts made to find out what was happening in the aft part of the submarine , and what sort of change was occurring in draft and trim .
RBZh-PL-82 , Article 42 : `` In case of accident the submarine senior watch officer is obligated : ... to
directly lead the personnel 's damage control efforts on the upper deck and in the superstructure when the submarine is on the surface. ''
The submarine had a zero trim by the stern as of 1300 .
Here is how the fourth and seventh sections of the government commission 's working group evaluated change in the submarine 's draft and trim over time , on the basis of an analysis of photographs taken from an airplane
Therefore all of the assertions that appeared later in the press regarding the alleged unexpected demise of the submarine , which hindered preparation of rescue equipment , are inconsistent with reality , and have the goal of covering up the inactivity of the ship 's leadership in rescuing the crew .
At 1239 an IL-38 airplane was dispatched to the accident location , for some reason without a submarine specialist aboard .
As a result the headquarters of the Northern Fleet was deprived of objective information up until the end of the tragedy , while the submarine was perhaps deprived of good recommendations that may have dramatically altered the subsequent progress of accident recovery efforts .
It was also communicated that an airplane was en route to the submarine with an estimated time of arrival of 1400 .
Unfortunately the headquarters of the Northern Fleet did not furnish documents to the government commission 's working group regarding communication exchanges between the distressed submarine and the fleet command post .
It may be concluded from the radio messages that the submarine command concealed the true scale of the accident from the headquarters of the Northern Fleet from the very beginning .
How could there be any talk of submerging the submarine in a disaster of such a scale ?
The list to port was a constant concern to the submarine command .
Two and a half hours had gone by after the submarine surfaced .
During this time the attack center could have ascertained that a list of 6-8 degrees is not dangerous to a submarine , and that it would make no sense to waste time and resources correcting it .
Contrary to this , the submarine command stubbornly tried to correct the list , and in doing so , it used the most irrational method .
Sending the damage control party to compartment 6 meant that in the opinion of the submarine command the fire had gone out in it , and pressure in the distressed compartments had fallen to a value close to 0 .
By this time , taking the actual draft of the submarine into account , the scupper grates of this tank were at a depth of 4.5-5 meters -- that is , pressure in the distressed compartments was equal to the pressure in the main ballast tank .
And it is difficult to say what other misfortunes would have come upon the submarine and its crew .
The airplane arrived in the accident region and established communication with the submarine , and the first photographs were taken .
It was communicated from the airplane that surface ships would reach the submarine by 1800 .
At this time a query was transmitted to the submarine from Northern Fleet headquarters by way of the airplane regarding entry of water into the pressure hull and regarding the fire .
The attention of the submarine command was simultaneously turned to the need for utilizing all possibilities of the LOKh system to deliver freon into compartments 6 and 7 , to sealing off the aft compartments , to preventing gas contamination of the other compartments of the submarine , to continually monitoring the gas composition in the compartments and to making economical use of individual protective equipment .
In the meantime the submarine began tipping to starboard as the starboard main ballast tank No. 10 filled .
RBZh-PL-82 , Article 98 : `` To maintain permissible concentrations of gases -LRB- toxic substances -RRB- in the atmosphere of compartments adjacent to distressed compartments , after the submarine rises to the surface these compartments must be vented into the atmosphere to the extent possible. ''
The submarine 's leadership had no basis for asserting that the fire was still burning in the distressed compartments .
High-pressure air did in fact remain only in one commander 's tank group , but this happened over 3 hours previously , and since that time there was no air in the submarine 's mains , and the air-foam fire extinguishing system was not working .
The submarine needed a tow as of 1123 , when according to the entry in the control log for the main propulsion unit the emergency safety rods and shim rods of the reactor were rested against their lower limit switches .
The assertion of the submarine command that water was not entering the pressure hull was also groundless .
Listing of the submarine had shifted to starboard .
Processes that were not controlled and not thought out by the leadership were occurring aboard the submarine : surfacing with a list , growth of pressure in distressed compartments , dropping of this pressure , shifting of listing to the other side , increasing trim by the stern .
On the whole these messages did not reflect the actual state of the distressed submarine , and disoriented the Northern Fleet 's command post .
The government commission 's working group felt that entry of water into the submarine 's pressure hull began after 1400 , and by 1500 the quantity of water that had entered compartment 7 was 20 tonnes , which was reflected in the joint act of sections 4 and 7 of this working group .
1538 -- Message received : A submarine is 100 km away , moving toward us at 14 knots .
A Soviet submarine was traveling toward the accident location .
After the message was received from the submarine at 1535 , the commander of the Northern Fleet gave orders to prepare freon in canisters and 10 sets of air-dropped rescue containers -LRB- KAS- 150 -RRB- to be delivered to the accident location by an Il-38 airplane .
It is unclear how the freon canisters were to be transferred from the airplane to the submarine .
The standard submarine supply table lacks special instruments with which to check bulkhead temperature .
It was clear that submarine damage control efforts were gradually shutting down .
Much was written in the press about `` explosions , '' after which the submarine quickly sank .
Thus , Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev stated : `` Explosions were heard aboard the submarine in the aft compartments at 1624 .
The submarine acquired a trim by the stern , which attested to entry of water into the pressure hull and a danger of flooding. '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 45 -LSB- / -RSB-
A clear cause-and-effect relationship is drawn here between the `` explosions '' on one hand and abrupt worsening of the situation and the submarine 's demise on the other .
Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` Explosions began at the stern , explosions that shook the submarine .
The submarine was jarred , but not strongly enough to rupture the pressure hull. ''
This was an hour before the submarine sank .
And more likely the `` explosions '' that were `` heard '' by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada in the conning tower superstructure and by Vice Admiral Zaytsev in Moscow have no relationship to actual events aboard the distressed submarine .
Several words should be said about the jarring of the submarine observed during the time of the accident .
They began 30 minutes after surfacing , and they went on throughout the entire time the submarine was on the surface. ''
It is obvious from this statement that the submarine 's shaking had nothing in common with `` explosions , '' and it was associated with entry of air into the distressed compartments from the high- pressure air system , blowing and flooding of main ballast tanks , escape of gases from the distressed compartments and entry of water into the pressure hull .
What was the crew 's assessment of the status of the distressed submarine at 1624 , when information concerning `` explosions '' was entered into the ship 's log ?
`` Yes , we were all truly certain until the last minutes that we would be able to save the submarine .
The submarine 's trim did not change until 1620 , and there were no signs of water entering the pressure hull. ''
The report was received from the submarine at 1635 : `` The fire is intensifying .
The loss of buoyancy reserve and the decrease in longitudinal stability of the submarine may have been determined by measuring its draft , and with a few simple computations .
In sending the message cited here , as early as before 1635 the submarine leadership already believed that the ship was destined to sink .
6 , 1989 -RRB- : `` Confident reports prior to 1635 indicate that ship damage control efforts were proceeding according to plan , that the situation aboard the submarine was being monitored , and that entry of water into the pressure hull was not noted. ''
How do we explain such an abrupt change in the nature of messages from the distressed submarine ?
How suitable was this decision , and how did it affect the stability and unsinkability of the submarine ?
Main ballast tanks No. 5 and 7 are situated forward of the submarine 's center of gravity .
When they are blown , in addition to an increase in buoyancy reserve the submarine 's trim by the stern increases .
The attitude of the submarine worsened , and remaining high-pressure air was expended purposelessly , even though it could have been used with great benefit to blow main ballast tank No. 10 through the air line servicing the outboard devices .
When two main ballast tanks on one side were blown simultaneously , the submarine was shaken severely , and it tilted abruptly toward the stern .
This abrupt change in the submarine 's attitude was the cause of change in the nature of accident reports .
At 1630 the magnitude of longitudinal stability reached such low values that rapid growth of trim and the tragic outcome of the events may have been also seen by the `` unaided eye '' of a nonspecialist , and the submarine 's possible sinking raised alarm , without a single ray of hope .
Senior Lieutenant of Medical Service L. A. Zayats -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` Somewhere around 1630-1340 I went up out of the submarine for the last time .
It would be pertinent to recall here the previously cited assertion by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada that the submarine 's trim did not change before 1620 .
Messages received from the submarine at 1635 and 1641 were like a bolt out of the blue to the naval command .
What would you expect the Northern Fleet commander to think upon receiving such a confident report which , Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev feels , `` indicates that ship damage control efforts were proceeding according to plan , that the situation aboard the submarine was being monitored etc. '' And at the same time : From the ship 's log : 1642 -- `` Prepare for evacuation .
It says evacuate the entire submarine crew .
Thus when it sent the message that the Northern Fleet 's command post received at 1635 , the submarine 's leadership already believed that the ship was doomed .
It is one thing to evacuate to approaching vessels , and another thing into the waters of the Norwegian Sea .
From the interrogation tape recordings : Lieutenant A. L. Stepanov : `` After this I went below to prepare the secret literature for evacuation , because the commander said that ships would be approaching now , and only a mooring party would remain aboard the submarine . ''
'' How were the submarine personnel prepared for evacuation .
Such was the explanation given by the captain 1st rank to the wide masses of laborers to his egress topside from the submarine .
We realized from the dynamics of increasing list to starboard and trim by the stern that the submarine would not be able to remain afloat until 1800 , and so the personnel were given the command to `` go topside '' at 1650 . ''
Thus the crew of the submarine was preparing for evacuation to approaching vessels , although its leadership already knew at this time that they would have to evacuate into the water , into the Norwegian Sea .
Use of the high-pressure air reserve in the commander 's tank group for damage control would have radically altered the situation aboard the submarine even in the last stage of the accident .
Given all of the conditions , this would have kept the submarine afloat until the arrival of the tender `` Aleksey Khlobystov '' .
These bits of paper turned out to be more precious to the submarine 's leadership than the lives of the people .
Lieutenant A. L. Stepanov -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` Everyone in the submarine was preparing for evacuation to a vessel .
The submarine commander gave orders to prepare secret documents for evacuation .
We left the secrets in the submarine and raced topside. ''
Lieutenant Zaytsev 's assertion that it was dark at this moment in the submarine is inconsistent with reality , and is not confirmed by a single participant of the tragedy .
Can any navy staffer guarantee that the contents of this box , as well as of the other boxes and bags , are lying at the bottom of the Norwegian Sea , and not being studied in other countries ?
The submarine 's leadership failed to give the order to prepare the LAS - 5M rescue boat located in compartment 1 , and it did not give the command in time to prepare rafts and the rescue chamber for separation from the submarine .
Fulfilling the incompetent order to close shut-off 1 of the exhaust ventilation system , Warrant Officer Kadantsev simultaneously opened the exhaust ventilation shaft flooding valve -- that is , he unwittingly promoted faster flooding of the submarine .
The rescue vessels were still far away , while the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea were right there .
Because of the poor administrative skills of the submarine 's leadership , most of the crew was without them .
Immediately after the submarine surfaced , the personnel began preparing the PSN- 20 rescue rafts for launching .
Submarine Senior Watch Officer Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` All I had were two log books for the rafts and some brief written instructions .
I never did realize that the submarine was sinking , and so I continued pulling at the raft .
Suddenly the water went over my head as the submarine rose to vertical and the impact of the water .
As the submarine sank further , the positive buoyancy of the raft caused the line by which it was secured to the railing on the conning tower superstructure to break , and it rose to the surface .
`` Armchair-seamen '' journalists began a campaign bemoaning and deriding Russian equipment and seeking its mythical inadequacies on the basis of statements by such `` experts '' in the press , but more about that later .
It was precisely at this time that the last message was received from the submarine : `` Trim increasing abruptly .
The Rescue Chamber : Much was written in the press about why submarine commander Captain 1st Rank Ye .
A. Vanin went back down into the submarine .
In the opinion of the authors of such articles , while topside the commander learned that there were still people down below , and this motivated him to go back inside the submarine .
So why did the commander , who was topside , go back inside the submarine ?
Apparently the submarine commander went topside in order to estimate the situation and to give the order to prepare the rescue chamber for separation from the ship , because at this time all the personnel were topside .
I ran back for Ispenkov , and at that moment the submarine tilted severely to the stern .
In addition Slyusarenko 's statement confirms that the lighting was functioning in the submarine 's compartments until the very last moment , and Lieutenant Zaytsev 's assertion of the reverse is inconsistent with reality .
Under certain conditions the chamber could have become a very great aid in survival of people in the frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea .
It should be stated that the question of the possibility of detaching the surface chamber from the submarine when the latter collapses at depth -LRB- known as damage control problem No 4 -RRB- was examined in the planning process , but work on this variant produced a negative result .
The rescue chamber is secured at its coaming by a rack-and-pinion release to the coaming of the submarine , such that a waterproof space -LRB- the fore chamber -RRB- is created between it and the ship 's hull .
Detaching the rescue chamber after its occupation by the crew requires : closing and locking the lower conning tower hatch and the lower hatch of the rescue chamber ; setting the catch manually ; turning the rack-and-pinion ring pneumatically or by hand ; filling the fore chamber with water and equalizing its pressure with the outside water pressure ; when necessary , feeding air to the pneumatic pusher for initial separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine .
The submarine was already going down , but I managed to force the upper conning tower hatch down with my legs. ''
Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev -LRB- the newspaper PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA , 20 April 1989 -RRB- : `` They were in the VSK .
It was not until the submarine 's trim equalized that Captain 3d Rank Yudin and Warrant Officer Chernikov were able to drag Warrant Officer Slyusarenko into the chamber .
Before the hatch was closed we heard noise recalling boiling water -- obviously air was escaping from the sinking submarine . ''
As we can see from this , air entered the chamber from the submarine at the moment the lower hatch of the rescue chamber was being battened down , creating an elevated pressure within it .
In addition the rescue chamber was `` tethered '' by this hose to the submarine 's pressure hull .
This meant that the rescue chamber could surface only after the submarine compartments were completely flooded and the pressure within it was equalized with outside pressure , on the condition that the chamber 's buoyancy would be sufficient to break the air hose .
The sequence of the personnel 's actions following separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine was presented somewhat differently in Warrant Officer Slyusarenko 's explanatory report .
We can not be fully certain that the personnel had carried out all of the operation to separate the rescue chamber from the submarine correctly , even with the help of the posted instructions .
With the lower conning tower hatch open , the crew could not have done anything to separate the rescue chamber from the submarine until pressure within the submarine equalized with the outside water pressure .
Opening of the fore chamber flooding valve produced no results because the lower conning tower hatch was open , and outside pressure continued to press the rescue chamber against the coaming of the submarine 's pressure hull with great force .
The nature of the damage and the positions of the damaged structures clearly indicate that this damage occurred after the submarine struck bottom .
Of all the possible causes of damage to the upper cover of the entry hatch -LRB- explosion of ammunition , explosion of gases released from the storage battery or torpedoes , a shock wave caused by elastic deformations of the pressure hull as the submarine struck bottom , and hydraulic shock occurring with rupture of the pressure tanks -RRB- , hydraulic shock is the most probable cause .
When the submarine struck bottom , the pressure tanks in compartments 2 and 3 ruptured , producing a hydraulic shock .
It damaged the upper cover of the entry hatch of compartment 1 , and helped the rescue chamber to separate from the submarine .
In 1975 , during strength trials on an experimental compartment of this submarine , the testing chamber was ruptured by a hydraulic shock .
The conditions causing it were repeated in relation to many parameters during the submarine tragedy .
The attempts by Slyusarenko and Chernikov to place the mask of the breathing apparatus over the submarine commander 's head were unsuccessful .
We were all without life jackets , no one had expected the submarine to disappear so quickly. ''
And in the newspaper PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA -LRB- 20 April 1989 -RRB- the participants of the event shared their memories : Captain Lieutenant V. A. Gregulev : `` And some did n't know how to swim .
All of the subsequent actions by warrant officers Slyusarenko and Chernikov to put the IDA-59 masks over the faces of Yudin and submarine commander Vanin occurred while the rescue chamber was on the surface .
On an image of the visible part of the rack-and-pinion ring securing the rescue chamber to the submarine hull , one section of this ring may be classified as a section with a broken tooth .
The absence of imagery of the matching part of the release on the submarine 's pressure hull does not permit any definite conclusion .
This question could be clarified fully only by raising the rescue chamber or submarine .
In August - September 1991 a deep-sea submersible inspected the matching part of the rack-and-pinion release on the submarine 's pressure hull .
It sank together with the commander of the submarine , Captain 1st Rank Ye .
A. Vanin , Captain 3d Rank V. A. Yudin and Warrant Officer A. V. Krasnobayev , and it is now lying on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea with the upper hatch open , in ideal conditions for raising .
Analysis of the crew 's actions during the accident revealed its total inability to fight for the submarine 's survival .
2 . Until the very last moment of the tragedy there was a possibility for radically changing the situation in the fight for the submarine 's survival through active and competent actions , and in all cases , to keep it afloat until rescue vessels could arrive .
The submarine sank with 25 percent of its reserve of high-pressure air unused , with the diesel generator operating , with an operating electric power system , with working damage control equipment , and with functioning electric lighting .
The absence of the RBITS negatively affected both the crew 's training in submarine damage control problems and its actions during the accident .
The delay of the submarine 's attack center in transmitting the distress signal , the irresponsibility of the Northern Fleet 's command post in organizing rescue operations , the lack of any leadership by the ship 's command in evacuating the crew from the sinking submarine and the personnel 's poor knowledge of the rules of using rescue equipment were the causes of the demise of the greater part of the crew .
No real or imaginary imperfections in equipment , systems and the submarine itself were the cause of the accident and the fire in compartment 7 , or influenced the tragedy 's outcome .
And that this submarine had supposedly been classified as `` nominally '' in the first line -- that is , on the fighting team , with the `` grace '' of the navy .
The reader is supposed to make his own conclusion from this -- that the demands put upon the submarine were too great , that there could be little talk of quality when what the designer created was not a submarine but something incomprehensible .
This was a fighting submarine , and it was designed , built and transferred to the navy on the basis of standards and requirements imposed on a fighting submarine .
High specifications and performance characteristics and the reliability of the technical resources , confirmed by experimental operation , made it possible for the first time in naval practice to adopt this submarine in 1988 , to promote it up from the experimental category and award it the status of a fighting submarine .
Unfortunately this has not ended the discussion of the experimental submarine .
Moreover , for what sort of other operation can an experimental submarine be transferred besides experimental ?
And in order to be persuaded of this , it would be sufficient to compare experimental models of Russian articles at exhibitions with the series-manufactured models of these same articles sold in stores .
Professionals know that their presence in a submarine directly influences its survivability. ''
The vice admiral 's logic is astounding : If it is a unique submarine , then it must have unique design deficiencies .
reads : `` In the fight to save the submarine , the crew displayed self-sacrifice and courage , but in the situation as it was , the submarine could not be saved. ''
It was not until after his departure in summer 1987 that the attitude toward this crew , its training and time at sea changed abruptly for the better. ''
Vice Admiral Chernov commanded the submarine flotilla until June 1986 , and not until summer 1987 , as Kalashnikov asserts .
This would have been fully enough time to form and train a new crew for any submarine .
4 . Considerable attention needs to be devoted to an article by Captain 1st Rank -LRB- Reserve -RRB- A. N. Gorbachev , a former submarine commander , printed in the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA -LRB- 29 April 1989 -RRB- , and to his interview with this paper on 17 December 1989 .
In both publications Gorbachev blames the demise of the submariners and the submarine itself on the designer on the basis of rumors and talks with `` yardkeeper acquaintances '' of his .
But it is not among designers , it is not in ship building industry , it is not in the military acceptance system and , finally , it is not in the navy 's Main Directorate of Ship Building that we must seek those `` who sank this ship as well , '' as the captain 1st rank -LRB- reserve -RRB- does .
The fire was predestined by the poor preparation of the ship for the cruise and the grossest violations of the rules of operating the submarine 's equipment .
Nor was the compartment fully involved aboard the submarine in the initial period of the accident .
The former commander of the submarine asked some questions that sound very strange coming from him -- `` Who taught the submariners to use the life rafts and prepare them for use ?
What other word can you use to describe the attempt to blame the designer for the submarine 's demise without any proof or justifications ?
Nor could you have known that the American submarine `` Thrasher '' sank not due to `` inadequate underwater unsinkability '' but for an entirely different reason .
None of this information is contained in the adventure novels on the basis of which you probably developed your ideas about submarine building .
And do n't recall Admiral S. O. Makarov and Academician A. N. Krylov in vain , believe me that submarine designers also understand unsinkability and the procedure for designing particular systems and entire submarines .
Something has to be said about the articles written by the writer N. A. Cherkashin , a former submarine deputy commander for political affairs .
While I do not feel it necessary to fully analyze the author 's version of the crew 's actions during the accident , we do need to examine some of the questions associated with the submarine 's design , and dwell on just certain aspects of this version .
It was unique , because the nuclear- powered submarine was itself unique : a special hull , navigation at very great depth ... . '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 56 -LSB- / -RSB-
It seems that a fire depends on the structure and material of the hull , as well as on the depth at which a submarine travels .
As for design concepts not associated with deep-sea navigation , they are all standard ones , tested by many years of practical Soviet submarine ship building , and they correspond to the requirements of the navy , the sector 's standards , and state standards .
Five years of accident-free operation confirmed the high operating reliability of the submarine , and this time was fully sufficient to reveal any deficiencies , if there were any .
The author goes on to say : `` In discussing the causes of the disaster , even the most frantic revilers of the unfortunate crew are forced to kick the ball through their own goalposts : Accident prevention aboard this nuclear-powered submarine remained at the level of previous years .
As everyone knows , the captain 1st rank -LRB- reserve -RRB- is not a submarine builder , and if he is trying to `` score a goal , '' he is not at all doing it through his own goalposts .
A. Zelenskiy , Captain 2d Rank V. V. Stafanovskiy and many other submariners are not builders of submarines , but this does n't keep them from making a realistic assessment of the level of occupational training of submarine crews .
Their reference is to those responsible for the weak combat and occupational training of all submarine crews , to those who , rather than engaging in honest , open and principled dialogue , are hiding behind the backs of the deceased members of Captain 1st Rank Vanin 's crew , and who are dealing with dissidents out of public view .
Allow me to inform you , my respected writer , that the sorry specialists from the 1st Submarine Flotilla misled you .
It would be pertinent here to cite the following statement by division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada , as presented by the writer N. A. Cherkashin : `` The submarine behaved normally .
When compartments 6 and 7 are flooded at the same time that main ballast tank No. 10 is flooded , the submarine loses 50 percent of its buoyancy reserve at the stern .
This is not counting the unblown tank No. 5 and the flooded starboard tank No 7 . Elementary logic tells us that no submarine can remain afloat with such loss of buoyancy and with such an upsetting moment .
It was because of this professional incompetency that the crew found itself in the frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea without rescue equipment , and was forced to pay for this with its life .
In his effort to show the crew 's actions as heroic , Cherkashin loses his sense of proportion , and steps beyond all permissible limits : `` Not knowing yet whether the submarine was sinking or surfacing , the `` keeper of the reactor , '' remote-control group commander Captain Lieutenant Igor Orlov began shutting down the menacing heart of the nuclear-powered submarine .
It is shameful for the former submarine deputy commander for political affairs not to know that any action associated with changing a submarine 's propulsion parameters is made only on the basis of orders from the attack center , and not on one 's own initiative .
The newspaper SMENA -LRB- 15 April 1990 -RRB- carried an article by Captain 1st Rank -LRB- Retired -RRB- V. A. Boyko titled `` No Culprits as Usual ? ''
As it turns out , in order to create submarines with `` tenacity , '' we need to first `` improve the concept of and requirements on submarine survivability , '' and not until this should we `` realize them in design and construction , and test them out in trials and during certification -- thus designing submarines with tenacity. ''
He is in a better position to know how imperfect the concepts of and requirements on submarine design are in relation to survivability .
cites specific `` deficiencies '' of the submarine which , in the opinion of the authors influenced the tragedy 's outcome .
The authors of the letter have other complaints against the structures of the submarine : `` The situation was aggravated by design deficiencies , to wit : The LOKh system ; the standard system for relieving excess pressure in distressed compartments ; an integrated system that would help the personnel to forecast the possible development of events in extreme situations on the basis of objective data ; the impossibility of controlling the airtightness of compartments from the control room . ''
Such a system does not exist in the navy 's requirements on submarine design .
The leadership of submarine formations is responsible for such development .
There is no need to bring up the fact that not a single submarine of the navy has an integrated system for forecasting possible development of events in extreme situations on the basis of objective data .
No submarines of the navy have a system for controlling the airtightness of compartments from the control room -LRB- with the exception of a certain class of submarine with a limited number of personnel -RRB- .
Development of such systems for manned compartments is not foreseen in the navy 's requirements on submarine design .
Introduction of such a system into a submarine would be equivalent to complicating the design , increasing the weight and size characteristics of the equipment , and reducing its reliability .
As for the degree to which these negative indicators could be compensated by the anticipated increase in submarine survivability , the answer to this question can be provided only through meticulous design development .
The list of `` design imperfections '' was signed by naval deputy commander -in- chief V. V. Zaytsev and it is called `` Submarine Design Peculiarities Influencing , in the Navy 's Opinion , the Advent and Development of Large and Fast-Developing Fires and Hindering Ship Damage Control . ''
None of the `` design peculiarities '' could have caused the accident and the demise of the submarine .
The `` consequences '' indicated by the authors do not reflect the actual circumstances of the accident , and they are directed at justifying the inactivity of the submarine 's leadership in ship damage control , and at covering up the mistakes it made .
But there 's one thing that raises questions : The deadline for fulfilling measures to organize training centers and to improve submarine basing and technical maintenance conditions , and measures in the social sphere , has been extended to the year 2000 , and most of the funds for scientific research and experimental design work -LRB- up to 75 percent -RRB- are to be spent on projects having nothing to do with the fire safety of submarines or their survivability , or with designing individual protective and rescue equipment for submariners .
Nor is optimism raised by the nonspecific nature of measures to create training centers and establish submarine basing and technical maintenance conditions .
The planned purchase of 50,000 survival suits abroad evokes bewilderment in light of the cheerful assertions by Vice Admiral R. L. Dymov , chief of the navy 's search and rescue service , that series production of Russian -made survival suits will begin in 1991 . -LSB- . sup -RSB- 63 -LSB- / -RSB-
This immediately brings to mind Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev 's `` classical '' pronouncement : `` Confident reports prior to 1635 indicate that ship damage control efforts were proceeding according to plan , that the situation aboard the submarine was being monitored , and that entry of water into the pressure hull was not noted. ''
2 . For practical purposes there was only one tank containing turbine oil in compartment 7 of the submarine , and not three -- a 9 m -LSB- . sup -RSB- 3 -LSB- / -RSB-
Five years of the submarine 's operation demonstrated the effectiveness of the system for removing oil vapor from the air of compartments .
The complaints of the authors of the remark that the designers failed to satisfy the requirements of the TPPL-75 -LSB- Submarine Design Requirements -RSB- are wrong .
Thus these TPPL- 75 were not introduced on any submarine of the navy .
Because such cable was difficult to manufacture , it was not used aboard any submarine .
Recommendations of the design office regarding the use of the submarine 's equipment in emergency situations , 21.GGK-E-478-82 , do not foresee closure of valves on oil pipelines when sealing compartment 7 .
In addition the design office did not draw up instructions , to be included in the operating documents , on testing the airtightness of intercompartment submarine bulkheads with a vacuum of 100 mm Hg -LRB- see Article 201 , RBZh-PL-82 -RRB- .
The attempt to criticize the `` Recommendations '' 21.GGK-E-478-82 drawn up by the designer is wrong , because they were not intended for use by submarine personnel .
The recommendations were drawn up in response to an assignment from the Naval Institute No. 1 specially to serve as the basis upon which this institute was to draw up the `` Manual on Combat Use of Technical Resources '' -LRB- RBITS -RRB- -- one of the fundamental documents of the set of submarine damage control documents .
Closure of these valves is not foreseen in the general section on sealing the bulkheads , because this affects submarine power and must be carried out on the basis of a decision of the control room -LRB- Article 89 , RBZh-PL-82 -RRB- .
4 . The complaint of the authors of the remark that the absence of instructions on testing the airtightness of the submarine 's intercompartment bulkheads with a 100 mm Hg vacuum is unjustified .
The designer 's operating and design documents do not foresee testing a submarine 's intercompartment bulkheads for airtightness with a 100 mm Hg vacuum , and there is nothing in Article 201 of the RBZh-PL-82 that says that such a test must be conducted on the basis of the designer 's documentation .
Later on these sources of hot gases were closed by the submarine 's personnel , which for practical purposes stopped the growth of pressure in compartment 5 ; the assertion of the authors of the remark that this mistake by the designer led to the death of personnel due to burns is a deliberate lie .
5 . `` The submarine design did not foresee a system with the necessary freon reserve for fast recharging of any LOKh station to provide for repeated delivery of freon to a distressed compartment in the presence of large fires in order to create a fire-quenching concentration .
Other resources capable of extinguishing a fire at elevated pressure are not foreseen by the submarine 's design .
The submarine lacks resources for extinguishing a fire at compartment pressures exceeding 2 kg /cm -LSB- . sup -RSB- 2 -LSB- / -RSB- . ''
It does not make any sense to introduce this information into LOKh system operations , because the instructions are not part of the set of submarine damage control documents .
Information on the fire extinguishing characteristics of freon and on the range of uses of the LOKh system should be contained in the RBZh-PL-82 , which is the principal submarine damage control document , in attachment No. 3 , `` Firefighting Resources . ''
The assertions of the authors of the remark that a fire extinguishing concentration of freon could not be created in compartments 6 and 7 because of the absence of freon reserves aboard the submarine are unfounded .
The consequences : This resulted in a fire in the GKP , which complicated leadership of submarine damage control efforts. ''
Compartment 3 filled with gas , and so the attack center was compelled to carry out the subsequent submarine damage control actions while wearing individual protective equipment .
The consequences : It is impossible in a major emergency situation to completely deenergize a submarine compartment , which is why the accident occurred and why a fire arose in compartment 4 . '' The designer 's conclusion : 1 .
Introduction of switching apparatus into control circuits unjustifiably complicates the circuits and reduces the reliability of a submarine 's electric power system as a whole .
Even after the circuit breaker tripped in the distribution panel RShchN- 12 , located in compartment 7 , the electric power system of the submarine remained serviceable , and continued to function until the end of the tragedy .
`` The kingstonless design of the TsGB sharply reduces the longitudinal stability of a submarine when it is not in trim and when the sea is disturbed .
The consequences : This resulted in the flooding of TsGB No. 8 , 9 , 10 and disturbance of their integrity , as a result of which the submarine lost buoyancy and longitudinal stability. ''
The line of reasoning of the authors of the remark suggesting that the kingstonless design of main ballast tanks sharply reduces the longitudinal stability of a submarine if it is not in trim and if the sea is disturbed is essentially incompetent .
A submarine does not go out of trim on its own , but as a result of a loss of buoyancy reserve when the end compartments or ballast tanks fill up ; in this case the submarine 's longitudinal stability also decreases regardless of the design of the main ballast tanks and the sea state .
In addition sea state begins to affect the buoyancy reserve of a submarine -LRB- and not its longitudinal stability , as the authors of the remark assert -RRB- at a sea state of 5 - 6 points or more .
The submarine surfaced with its starboard main ballast tanks No. 5 and 10 not blown .
The submarine sank as a result of flooding of compartment 7 and partially of compartment 6 , with absolutely no damage control efforts attempted by the personnel .
When any one of the cofferdams fails , the high- pressure air system provides for surfacing of the submarine and subsequent blowing of previously unblown main ballast tanks through the blowing line using air from the outboard air main with the assistance of a diver .
Field trials conducted on 2 - 3 November 1989 aboard a certain submarine with the participation of representatives from the designer , from the Naval Institute No. 1 , from the Naval Academy and from the Northern Fleet 's 1st Submarine Flotilla confirm the high effectiveness of blowing the main ballast tanks using the outboard air system , and maintenance of high effectiveness of blowing any tank regardless of the physical state of neighboring tanks .
`` The design does not foresee a system aboard the submarine for computerized documentation of events pertaining to calculation of stability and unsinkability , or an automated system producing recommendations to the leadership regarding damage control in major emergency situations .
In addition to this , the submarine lacks instruments by which to monitor the submarine 's static attitude in a disturbed sea -LRB- violation of the requirements of articles 9.2.5 ,
The means of objectively monitoring change in the submarine 's attitude are lacking , making it impossible for the GKP to correctly predict the submarine 's behavior when water enters a compartment and the TsGB . ''
`` The design does not foresee a system for monitoring the filling -LRB- blowing -RRB- of the submarine 's TsGB .
Not a single submarine of the navy has a system for monitoring the filling of main ballast tanks .
The consequences : RAVA hoses ruptured in response to fire and the elevated temperature in the compartment , which led to uncontrolled flooding of the compartment and loss of the submarine 's longitudinal stability and buoyancy. ''
As for the `` consequences '' : The operator at the main propulsion unit console did not fulfill requirements of articles 90 and 91 of the RBZh-PL-82 with regard to sealing off the distressed compartment , and he did not close the remotely controlled kingston valve of the stern-tube gland 's cooling system , which does not affect the submarine 's propulsion ; this resulted in entry of water into compartment 7 following rupture of the RAVA hose in response to the fire .
The submarine lacks a program supporting the reliability of technical resources -LRB- the requirements of Article 2.3 of the OTT6 .1.1 - 81
As for the essence of the issue : The requirements regarding reliability of particular systems and of the submarine as a whole were satisfied by the designer by issuing specifications on new equipment with high reliability indicators , and with the large volume of experimental design work carried out by the equipment manufacturer , including manufacture of experimental models of this equipment .
A log was developed and a spare set of equipment not used aboard other classes of submarines was delivered in order to keep the submarine 's reliability high .
The high reliability of equipment designed on the basis of the designer 's specifications and of the submarine as a whole manifested itself during the accident , in the course of which all equipment and systems operated without failure until the last moment , and all safety and blocking systems foreseen by the design worked , which ensured automatic accident-free shut- down of equipment of the main propulsion unit , including the reactor and the main turbogear unit .
During the accident these circuit breakers provided for automatic disconnection of damaged networks , distribution panels and damaged electrical equipment , and ensured trouble-free operation of the electric power system until the submarine 's demise .
Further entry of air into compartment 6 out of the high-pressure air system due to incorrect actions taken by the submarine 's command led to development of the fire and the increase in temperature in the compartment to 800-900ëC -LRB- according to calculations -RRB- at a compartment pressure of 13 kg /cm -LSB- . sup -RSB- 2 -LSB- / -RSB- .
personnel of compartment 2 were poisoned as a result of the incorrect actions of the commander of this compartment , who connected the SDS to the medium-pressure air system according to the back-up procedure , and then the submarine 's command , which disconnected the high- and medium-pressure mains without warning the personnel of compartment 2 of this ; 2 . personnel in compartment 5 were poisoned because the commander of this compartment failed to monitor operation of the SDS system , which was receiving air from the damaged cofferdam No. 1 of the high-pressure air main , and the incorrect actions of the attack center , on the instructions of which air was cut off to the medium- pressure air system without the personnel of the compartments being notified .
`` The number of personnel calculated by the central design office serving as the designer was insufficient to service equipment in normal conditions , and absolutely not enough to carry out submarine damage control in times of accident .
Without the consent of industry the navy increased the crew to 57 persons by its Directive No. 730/2/00395 dated 23 April 1982 ; in this case the number of personnel in BCh-5 was increased by only one person .
Apparently the navy felt that this number was fully sufficient for this department , which maintains technical resources and carries out submarine damage control .
Were the qualifications of the specialists adequate , the increase that was made in the crew size to 64 persons would have been quite enough to maintain the submarine under normal operating conditions .
The requirement of Article 173 of the RBZh-PL-82 , which prohibits a submarine from going to sea undermanned , was violated .
The submarine 's leadership used the commander of the damage control division for duties inconsistent with the prescriptions of Article 45 , RBZh-PL-82 , as a result of which neither the buoyancy and stability of the ship , nor expenditure of high-pressure air , nor pressure in the compartments was monitored , and competent actions were not taken in submarine damage control ; 2 . Captain 1st Rank Ye .
A. Vanin 's crew did not have sufficient knowledge of the material of the submarine , and its combat training level was very low in regard to ship damage control ; 3 . during the accident the submarine 's attack center displayed passiveness in ship damage control efforts , and certain decisions that it did make were incompetent as a rule ; 4 . the attempt by the authors of the remark to transfer the blame for the outcome of the accident onto the designer is directed at concealing the low occupational and combat readiness of Captain 1st Rank Vanin 's crew .
The consequences : Absence of communication made efficient leadership of submarine damage control practically impossible. ''
4 . The assertion of the authors of the remark that loss of communication made efficient leadership of submarine damage control practically impossible is inconsistent with reality , because all of the necessary and fundamental decisions and actions relating to ship damage control should have been carried out by personnel of compartment 3 -- that is , the compartment containing the attack center .
This assertion by the authors of the remark is only an excuse for the inactivity of the submarine 's command in damage control efforts .
2 . Article 12.2.9 of the TPPL-75 discusses relief of pressure by compressors in normal submarine operating conditions , which has nothing in common with the remarks here , and therefore the reference to it is incorrect .
In accordance with Article 275 of the RBZh-PL-82 , the responsibility of developing recommendations on relieving pressure in each compartment of a surfaced and a submerged submarine of each class is assigned to the naval formations .
The fire and gas contamination of the compartments were caused by the failure of the submarine 's command to fulfill the requirements of articles 89 and 121 , and the failure of the personnel to fulfill articles 90 and 91 of the RBZh-PL-82 regarding sealing off compartments , disconnecting high-pressure air and hydraulic system pipelines passing through the distressed compartment , and bleeding air reserves overboard from the damaged cofferdam No. 4 of the high- pressure air system .
The decision to relieve pressure was made by the submarine 's command at 1150 -- that is , at a time when the hydraulic system was disconnected and control over ship systems in the distressed compartments was lost , and pressure in the compartments attained 13 kg /cm -LSB- . sup -RSB- 2 -LSB- / -RSB- .
On 29 October 1955 the battleship `` Novorossiysk '' sank as a result of an outside explosion while standing at the main base of the Black Sea Fleet .
9 . Bringing a crew up to the first line means officially confirming the readiness of a submarine crew for independent navigation and patrol duty .
This is preceded by a theoretical course attended by the crew in the training center , its training under a program of shore training between cruises , and study of submarine material , instructions in manuals on operation of combat and technical resources of the ship and the organization of ship service , together with test cruises at sea and the passage of special tests , including in combat training and in organization of ship damage control .

It was the only submarine of its kind in the world : The most up-to-date and most deep-water .
A number of countries offered to help in formulating a plan to raise the submarine from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea .
That is to say they planned to freeze the submarine and lift it in the form of a block of ice .
Thus some people tried to demonstrate that the vessel could be pumped full of a special foaming material which would turn into foam rubber and ensure the buoyancy of the submarine , which would then float to the surface of its own accord .
Meanwhile the former USSR party leadership issued a decree tasking the appropriate organizations and departments with carrying out the work necessary to raise the sunken submarine .
However , expeditions to the bottom of the Norwegian Sea showed that it has also become impossible to raise the submarine from the technical point of view .
Using the manned deep-sea submersibles Mir-1 and Mir-2 , it has proved possible to descend to the site of the sunken submarine .
It seemed as if a blizzard was raging at the bottom of the Norwegian Sea .
The specialists were able to determine the exact position of the submarine .
The submarine 's position encouraged the specialists to think that they could execute their plan to raise the vessel .
After a thorough examination of the submarine it became apparent that the inner hull was badly damaged .
This could have happened during the depressurization and flooding of the submarine or at the moment when it hit the bottom .
This explosion damaged the submarine .
The submarine 's systems , instruments , and equipment had been transformed into scrap metal .
Basically , with every day that passes the nuclear warheads aboard the sunken submarine are being destroyed as a result of electrochemical corrosion on a large scale .
These photographs show that the water around the submarine was literally boiling .
These high temperatures caused the submarine 's special coating to peel off .
And owing to the difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the submarine , the vessel basically exploded .
Of all the suggestions they have received , the specialists from Arzamas-16 , the `` Rubin '' Central Design Bureau , and the Committee for Carrying Out Special-Purpose Underwater Operations under the Russian Federation Government have picked the safest -- constructing a kind of sarcophagus in the submarine 's nose section .
In other words , the intention is to cover the submarine 's nose cone with concrete at a depth of 1,700 meters .
The work will be financed by the Russian Federation Government .
This is not the only submarine which has sunk , but the attention which it attracts worldwide has serious reasons .
Furthermore , it appears that a few meters from the seabed an explosion occurred on the submarine .
Furthermore , the highest grade alloys from which the hull and the interior of the submarine were made , including the king of metals -- titanium -- which was used unsparingly to build the advanced submarine are corroding at dangerous speeds .
The submarine is lying on the slope of an underwater hill , as it were .
The white waterline on the nose of the submarine marks the division between two compartments .
The beryllium shell is all that separates the most toxic substance on Earth from the Norwegian Sea .
Tengiz Borisov : Any attempt to lift the submarine could lead to its disintegration and pollute the environment .
So we can not lift the submarine .
Various sorbents for measuring the presence of all possible radionuclides in the aura of the submarine are carried in a special compartment in the belly of the bathyscaphe .
The sorbents are placed in special grapnels which are attached to the hull of the submarine or buried in the seabed for a time .
The submarine sank on April 7 , 1989 .
Borisov said that raising the submarine was out of the question because its titanium hull , torpedo compartment hatch rods and bodies of the torpedoes , notably carrying nuclear warheads , were damaged .
Even though the nuclear reactor of the submarine was damaged , it was said to be safe with the radiation leak level being about 10 Ci per liter but the possible disintegration of torpedo nuclear warheads might result in leakage of plutonium and environmental damage .
The Russian government was said to have made a decision to appropriate the funds .
Once the sealing is done , Borisov said , a program of extracting nuclear warheads from the submarine will have to be devised .
Under the headline `` To Achieve Civil Accord in Russia `` , the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper features the full draft of the appropriate agreement -LRB- version 1 -RRB- of last March 27 .

The admiral stresses that `` the two sides should take into account , above all , military need and economic expediency '' while shaping up their relations with regard to the Black Sea Fleet .
The same newspaper runs a statement by Commander of Russian Border Troops Andrey Nikolayev to ITAR-TASS which is entitled `` Russia will not put up with pillage '' .
The newspaper writes that the press reports all the time about violations of Russian territorial waters by Japanese fishing vessels for illegal fishing .
In this connection , a decision was taken to launch a special operation on the eve of the fishing season to stop illegal fishing by foreign ships in the Pacific region , starting from April 20 .
The same newspaper runs information that the upper chamber of the Russian parliament did not accept on Wednesday the resignation of former Russian Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik .

Officials in the Northern Fleet 's press center told Interfax Thursday that radiometric and spectrometric sampling of the sea water and bottom suggested that there was no plutonium-239 in the spot where the submarine had sunk .
The gamma radiation at the sea surface ranged from 1.5 to 5 microRoentgen per hour .
According to the April 7 data , the radiation there stayed within background values .
As was noted at a meeting of senior ministry officials in Moscow on Monday , all is ready for an expedition to the Norwegian sea .
Since it is very hard to say how the submarine will fare in the future , it should be sealed as quickly as possible , Kravchenko said .
A Decision Has Been Made -- A Special Sarcophagus Will Cover the Nuclear Submarine `Komsomolets '
The research that was conducted this year has shown insignificant seepage of cesium and strontium radioactive isotopes from the nuclear submarine , which attests to a seal failure of the reactor and partial destruction of the pressure hull .
We have detected evidence of corrosion and fragments of the torpedoes ' warheads in the submarine 's torpedo tubes .
The Russian Academy of Sciences , Gosatomnadzor -LSB- State Committee for Nuclear Energy Oversight -RSB- , Minatom -LSB- Ministry of Atomic Energy -RSB- , environmental protection organs and the Ministry of Defense have supported the proposals of T. Borisov 's committee .
The torpedo launchers were partially demolished due to the submarine 's depressurizing .
There is an imminent danger of radioactive leakage into the environment due to a free water exchange in the afore sections of the atomic submarine .
The director of the Main Board for Underwater Rescuing Missions , Mikhail Talokolnikov , describes the forthcoming mission as follows : -LSB- Begin Talokolnikov recording , in Russian with superimposed English translation -RSB- To minimize radioactive leakage we have entrusted the mission with the following tasks .
Firstly , the mission should try to partially seal the afore sections of the submarine , using deep water submersible apparatuses .
Thirdly , it would examine the hub of the submarine and the floating rescue camera box , which has broken up and now lies at the bottom six km to the west of the submarine .
I shall recall that the final pressurizing of the submarine hub is due to take place in 1995 .
This will be a second stage in implementing the safety of the submarine .
One of the appliances will stay at the bottom of the sea to register medium radiation for one year after the mission is over .
The greatest potential danger relative to radiation in the ecological situation in the Norwegian Sea is posed by the two torpedoes each carrying 3,200 grams of plutonium 239 .
The above being the case , the expedition 's purpose consists of sealing the submarine 's forward section , monitoring the environment for radiation leakage , and maintaining checks on the technical condition of the craft .
According to the MChS leadership , the government of the Russian Federation is to provide all the funding .
Technical project development is to be accomplished under a contractual arrangement with the TsKB -LSB- Central Design Bureau -RSB- Rubin , with the participation of a number of scientific research institutions of the RAN -LSB- Russian Academy of Sciences -RSB- , the MO -LSB- Ministry of Defense -RSB- , and industrial organizations .
Scientific and technical aspects of the work will be handled by the Main Administration for Operations in Seas and Water Bodies , Russian Emergencies Ministry , with the participation of specialists from a Ministry of Defense TsNII -LSB- Central Scientific Research Institute -RSB- and from 40 Ministry of Defense GNIIs -LSB- state scientific research institutes -RSB- on a contractual basis .
A Committee for Special Underwater Operations -LRB- CSUO -RRB- was created to coordinate all efforts in this area , and a project was devised for sealing the submarine and its nuclear cargo right on the seafloor using a special substance known as khitozan , which has high sorption properties .
Repairs on the research vessel Akademik Keldysh were completed in Germany , the Mir units underwent repairs in Finland , and contracts began being concluded with Russian enterprises for deliveries of equipment .
The CSUO was abolished on January 10 , 1994 , in connection with the establishment of the Russian Federation Ministry for Emergencies , and its functions were transferred to one of the new structure 's administrations .
While the expedition was the only `` headache '' for the CSUO , for the leadership of the Ministry for Emergencies , with all its other concerns , solving problems relating to a submarine on the bottom of the faraway Norwegian Sea proved by no means a top priority , something that was quick to have negative consequences .
A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is exceedingly probable .
Meanwhile , a lack of interest in accelerating efforts to prevent it is being shown by not only the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources , but also by the Ministry for Emergencies .
If the Akademik Keldysh , with the Mir units aboard , does put out to sea all the same and the operation , God forbid , collapses at sea , full blame for the collapse will rest with incompetent ministry officials who were unable to think through all the details .
In other words , the foundation has assumed the role of lobbyist for Dutch interests in matters relating to the Russian submarine .
In the final analysis , in order to avert an environmental disaster , we could sacrifice the interests of Russian industrialists .
Hiring for the project Dutch firms that do not have deep-water units at their disposal but do own hoisting cranes will most likely lead to a fundamental revision of the entire plan of action and to replacement of the plan to seal the submarine with a plan to raise it .
In that case , it will no longer be possible to mount an expedition to the Norwegian Sea this season , and an environmental disaster will become almost inevitable .
The section of the ocean where the submarine lies is one of the most productive , accounting for 80 percent of all fish taken from the Norwegian Sea .
Considering that the half-life of plutonium is 24,000 years , the sea in that region will be closed to fishing for 600 to 700 years .
The submarine has two torpedoes on board with nuclear warheads , and these fill specialists with the greatest apprehension , the deputy minister said .
At the very same time Academician Vladimir Zuyev , department head at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Oceanology , has sent a letter to the Russian president 's staff .
Several nuclear-powered ships have sunk in recent years , and so much radioactive waste has been dumped in the oceans that the possibility of a leak of plutonium from two torpedoes appears a mere trifle compared with the constant discharge of radiation from these graveyards .
First , the submarine lies off the coast of Norway , in Norway 's traditional fishing grounds .
True , not all the specialists familiar with the situation on the submarine share the anxiety of Tengiz Borisov , his colleagues at the Institute of Oceanology , or other scientists and practical underwater workers .
The IZVESTIYA editorial office has a copy of this opinion of the Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics , approved by Academicians Yuriy Trutnev and Stanislav Voronin of the Russian Academy of Sciences , the chief designers of nuclear warheads .
They can be moved by underwater currents any distance from the scene of the tragedy and thus end up , ultimately , in the food of someone living thousands of kilometers from the Norwegian Sea .
A similar conclusion was reached by the Russian Security Council Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Safety , which discussed this problem at the end of last year .
Particularly as the Ministry for Emergency Situations , as Sergey Khetagurov declared , is ready and has plans to carry out the special expedition to seal the stricken submarine ?
In the opinion of many specialists with whom I have spoken about this , work on corrosion-proofing the sunken submarine is being hindered by departmental differences and by ambitions which , no less than the actual corrosion , are eating away at formerly amicable and united collectives .
Ships with deep-water apparatus on board could be delayed from putting to sea because ecological expertise and money are lacking and all the necessary equipment has still to be prepared .
There is an extremely great need today for a government program for the corrosion-proofing of the sunken submarine -- a program approved by the president and with powers to involve all the necessary organizations and structures in this operation .

German mark -LSB- DM -RSB- project overwhelmingly by private investment .
Krueger and Wissman spoke of a `` signal for Germany as a leading center of industry '' and of a sign of the country 's future viability .
Magnetic levitation was power-saving , quiet , and safe ; Germany , moreover , still had five to 10 years ' lead over the United States and Japan in this technology .
Coalition deputies such as Kurt Faltlhauser -LRB- CSU -LSB- Christian Social Union -RSB- -RRB- , Christian Lenzer -LRB- CDU -RRB- , and Horst Friedrich -LRB- FDP -LSB- Free Democratic Party of Germany -RSB- -RRB- spoke in support of the plan and called for rapid implementation .
SPD -LSB- Social Democratic Party of Germany -RSB- industry spokesman Uwe Jens welcomed the project as well .
Technology and Transportation Representative for Germany As an Industrial Base .
It is at the same time proof of German industry 's innovation strength .
His Reich patent from the year 1934 for a `` levitation railway with wheelless vehicles that by means of magnetic fields are guided levitating along iron tracks '' -LRB- DRP -LSB- German Reich Patent -RSB- 64 33 16 -RRB- was more than the vision of a young engineer who was ahead of his time , for the possibilities in electronics and vehicle construction were still very limited at that time .
We -- my comrades -in- arms and I -- were then conscious of the awakening in a new era of railway technology in which Germany had played a leading role all along .
So , railway history has been written since 1984 in North Germany , between Lathen and Dorpen .
Its readiness for use was certified at the end of 1991 after comprehensive testing and assessment by the German Federal Railways and leading university institutes .
This was also proof of German industry 's leading role in a high technology that has now made the breakthrough to worldwide marketing , in addition to its use for a new transportation representative -- especially after the affirmative decision for Berlin -to- Hamburg .
Only because of this is it possible now that a particularly attractive and environmentally compatible transportation system will open its service between the two largest German cities , Berlin and Hamburg , at the beginning of the new millennium .
With funds from all of the Japan Railways -LRB- JR -RRB- companies , surveys and tests were performed on the electromagnetic oscillation characteristics under a wide range of test conditions for superconducting magnets using electromagnetic oscillation test equipment .
The Shinkansen noise standard in Japan evaluates the peak value of the train during transit .
No safety standards concerning magnetic fields have been established in Japan .
While there is no proof that magnetic fields are harmful to health , example standard values for fluctuating magnetic fields established nationally in foreign countries are 50 gauss or less at 50 Hz in the German Industrial Standard and 20 gauss or less at 100 Hz established by the British Radiation Protection Committee .
It is said that the premise of this experiment was land travel and , unlike the linear motor car that is being tested at the Japan Railways -LRB- JR -RRB- Research Institute in Miyagi Prefecture , which levitates only at high speeds , the ME03 can float even at standstill and is well-suited for city transport .
Therefore it is doubtful whether the Bundesrat , in which the Social Democratic Party of Germany -LSB- SPD -RSB- has a majority , will vote for the planning law .
The construction of the magnetic link is to cost 8.9 billion German marks -LSB- DM -RSB- , with the federation contributing DM5.6 billion to the construction of the route .
The finished link is to be run on a private basis by the German Federal Railroad and Lufthansa , and is to be completed by 2005 .
German Railways and Bundeswehr Do Not Use DBP Telekom : Special Communications Networks Are a Specialty of Stuttgart 's Alcatel-SEL : New Railway System Is ISDN-Capable for Digital and Analog Connections
Instead of using the DBP Telekom system , power companies , the Bundeswehr , and the German Railways have their own communications systems .
While Mister Average Citizen , providing he or she is not telephoning via a private D2 mobile system , as a customer of the DBP -LRB- German Federal Post Office -RRB- Telekom , uses the postal service 's line system , the military and the railway employees enjoy a privilege .
The German military is especially ambitious .
The technology underlying the special networks is the Alcatel 1000 S12 System , which had been developed for public communications use and which is used in Germany and in many other countries of the world by DBP Telekom .
An actual contract is the new nationwide ISDN-network for the German Federal Railways -- the former State-run Bundesbahn and Reichsbahn .
The technology may be seen in the example of the German Railways system .
In future , the German Railways system could become of interest to the telephone companies .
The telephone monopoly in the countries of the European Union ends in 1998 and , according to the Wolfgang Boetsch , the German Minister of the Postal Service , the network monopoly will no longer be able to be maintained .
For the German Railways , this will mean that its nationwide communications system could be opened up to private customers .
The German Railways ' new extensive system is entirely comparable to the Telekom system as far as extensive interconnections are concerned .
After 24 years ' development and a 100 , 000km trip to nowhere on a test track in Emsland , north Germany , it yesterday received the technical all-clear , backing from senior politicians and the green light from the federal railways board .
IF Japan has a national goal for the 1990s it is to bridge the gap between its First -World economy and Third-World standard of living by focusing massive investment on a woefully inadequate social infrastructure .
'Thirty per cent of construction activity is public works and 70 per cent private at most general construction and mid-sized companies , so public spending alone can not offset private declines , ' says Ms Akemi Toyonaga , construction industry analyst for Credit Lyonnais Securities -LRB- Japan -RRB- .
'The large projects may attract attention from the media and contractors , but in the end they are likely to be far less important to average Japanese . '
The Y1 , 430bn island terminal will be the cornerstone of the Kansai region 's efforts to draw business to Osaka , Kobe and Kyoto and will be Japan 's first 24-hour air terminal .
Along Japan 's most congested waterfront , the Trans- Tokyo Bay Highway is scheduled in 1998 to connect Kawasaki , just south-west of the capital , with Kisarazu on the relatively pristine Boso Peninsula , site of the Kazusa Research Park and numerous tourist and resort developments .
In Yokohama , the Y2 , 000bn Minato Mirai 21 project will house Japan 's tallest building , 75 stories high , on reclaimed land .
Japan 's quasi-public organisations are another source of heavy infrastructure spending .
For example , the Japan Railways -LRB- JR -RRB- group plans to extend its bullet train lines .
Japan 's now private telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph & Telephone is also planning an aggressive infrastructure enhancement programme in the 1990s .
High speed rail services have their origins in the Japanese bullet train or Shinkansen which first went into service between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964 .
It is France where high speed trains have made the biggest impact and where the most comprehensive network has been established although Germany , too , is creating an ambitious network of high speed services .
Germany began developing a high speed network of InterCity Express -LRB- ICE -RRB- trains in 1988 and now has three routes in service including a link with Berlin .
For the past 10 years a 90 -tonne machine has been tearing around an elevated concrete track in north- west Germany , reaching speeds of up to 450kph but making none of the noise made by aircraft travelling at that speed .
Now , after years of debate , the German government has approved plans to build a 284km track between Berlin and Hamburg , Germany 's two biggest cities , in a move that is expected to take passengers away from those airlines flying the route .
Tests have shown that the vehicle uses less energy and is quieter than the French TGV -LRB- Train a Grande Vitesse -RRB- or the German InterCity Express -LRB- ICE -RRB- , the two high-speed trains which are its main competitors .
The government hopes that by 2004 a runway - similar to the present test track - will be built and that more than 14m passengers a year will be hurtling between Germany 's two biggest cities .
The Japanese are working on similar technology but opted in the early 1970s for an electrodynamic levitation system - where magnets repel rather than attract each other .
The different system also creates a 10cm gap , rather than 10mm , between the vehicle and the runway which the Japanese say is better suited to deal with earthquake risks .
The Transrapid technology creates magnetic fields of about 40 amps - no bigger than those created by an electric razor - while the Japanese have to grapple with big magnetic fields of up to 700,000 amps .
About four times as much electricity is needed to control the movement of the Japanese train across such big magnetic fields and Thyssen says they are so powerful it is thought people wearing pacemakers will not be able to use the trains .
The French National Railroad , which wants to build and operate a similar rail line between Las Vegas and Anaheim , had found a way to top its competition , the West Germans .
Roth and eight other members of the 16 -person commission rode the French train in shifts Friday and Saturday as part of a 10-day `` technology tour '' aimed at examining the French and German competitors up close .
`` On the maglev I felt more secure , '' said Aram Keith , president of Costa Mesa -based Keith Engineering , referring to the German train .
The French train 's coaches are narrower than those used for the maglev vehicle in Germany but they are much heavier .
I think there is room for both the French and German technologies in America , '' she said .
French officials argue that their train has a proven record of carrying millions of passengers each year at a profit while the West Germans still have their maglev confined to a test track .
On Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet declared itself in favor of building the Transrapid magnetic levitation railway from Hamburg to Berlin on the basis of a new financing strategy submitted by industry .
Hamburg High-Speed Maglev Railway Limited Liability Company -RSB- , under the rubric `` Vistas '94 '' : `` ` Transrapid ' Has Now Made the Breakthrough to Worldwide Marketing .
For High-Speed Maglev Railway Head Hans G. Raschbichler Success Is Also an Indication of Engineers ' Forcefulness ''
With the government 's affirmative decision to build the Transrapid high-speed maglev railway , a decision was made that reaches far into the future in terms of transportation and environmental policy .
Hans Georg Raschbichler , chief managing executive of Berlin - Hamburg High-Speed Maglev Railway Limited Liability Company , takes this view in the following article .
If in 1835 it was the first railroad that began its triumphant march as a new transportation representative on the Nuremberg -to- FÆurth line , so at the beginning of the 21st century it will be the high-speed maglev railway that revolutionizes our transportation system .
His idea was to replace the railway 's wheels with electromagnets .
He knew that magnetic forces can assume the carrying and guiding functions of the wheel and track and thus enable no-contact levitation with high speeds and low noise generation .
The results of the high-capacity high-speed railway study completed in 1971 were so positive that the development work begun soon led to the first experimental vehicles having quite different designs .
As a young engineer , I began my work on the development of the high-speed maglev railway in the middle of the sixties .
A pilot system having a new design -- the so-called long-stator maglev railway technology -- was able to be put into operation successfully in Kassel as a result of a joint effort begun in 1974 with Professor Weh of Braunschweig Technical University .
In this design the motor is not located in the vehicle as usually , but in the railway .
It was decided to focus further work on the long-stator maglev railway technology .
The success in Hamburg was also decisive for the construction of the pilot system unique in the world for railway systems , the Emsland Transrapid Pilot System -LRB- TVE -RRB- .
The Transrapid high-speed maglev railway has proven its everyday usefulness in continuous service with a running capacity of more than 160,000 km and a world-record speed of 450 km/h .
When I sum up personally today , after working nearly 30 years in high-speed maglev railway development , I come to the conclusion that it was decisive for success that we -- the engineers , companies and politicians -- steadily kept up our common commitment over so long a time , in spite of often serious obstacles and setbacks .
Also a prerequisite for this is the plan -- which is no less innovative -- adopted by the federal government for the financing and private-sector operation of the Berlin - Hamburg high-speed maglev railway .
For example , the operating company that will operate the high-speed maglev railway will be privately financed for the first time .
Furthermore , the financing proposal also provides for a high degree of taking the burden off the federal government in financing of the railway .
It will prove strikingly the creativity and forcefulness of engineers , who with the high-speed maglev railway have also continued a part of the tradition showing them to be pioneers of progress .
Although over 25 years have passed since development began on superconducting magnetic levitation -LRB- maglev -RRB- rail systems , the steady stream of research results is at the verge of blossoming .
As reflected in the recent name change from ultra high-speed rail to magnetic levitation rail , not only is high speed sought , but importance is placed on the low noise and ease of maintenance characteristics of a noncontact railway , which has a drive method that does not depend on adhesion , and on energy conservation by using lighter weight cars , which is a feature of a primary ground system -LRB- driving and controlling the car is mainly performed by ground facilities -RRB- .
Before development began at the Railway Technical Research Institute , the MLU002 test vehicle was completed in March 1987 and began trial runs on the Miyazaki test track .
However , quench , the state where superconductivity is not maintained , occurred frequently in the superconducting magnet , the most important element in superconducting magnetic levitation .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- To achieve improved reliability of the superconducting magnets and low magnetic field leakage into the cars , the pole pitch of the superconducting magnets is shortened .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- In order to increase energy savings , the method used is sidewall levitation where the levitation coils are shaped like the number eight and have small magnetic repulsive force -LRB- magnetic resistive force -RRB- .
A large levitation force is obtained by using sidewall levitation .
As explained earlier , the most important issue in implementing a maglev railway is improving the stability and reliability of the superconducting magnets .
In particular , the mechanical strength of the epoxy resin that is the mold material for the sidewall levitation coils was carefully checked .
Similar to airplanes , cars in maglev railway travel are not in contact with anything when traveling in the high-speed region , therefore , the quality of the noise differs from that of railroads .
Experts have pointed out that the reason for the large power consumption in the running tests at the Miyazaki test track is a maglev railway is a transportation method with poor energy efficiency .
Since the ground facilities for a maglev railway use many drivers and controllers in the primary ground method , the cars can be much slimmer than conventional cars .
There is the impression that a maglev railway generates strong magnetic fields that harm the human body .
In fact , the effect of the magnetic fields generated by the superconducting magnets on the passengers and on people who live along the track is at the same level as the magnetic fields they normally live in .
Many electrical appliances like electric razors , hair dryers , televisions , and washing machines that everyone uses have magnetic fields .
The magnetic fields of medical treatment pads -LRB- 1,300 gauss -RRB- for stiff shoulders or magnetic necklaces are also close to the body .
Furthermore , the whole body is exposed to a maximum of 20,000 gauss -LRB- stationary magnetic field -RRB- in magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- equipment that is rapidly spreading in the medical field to image tomograms .
Of course , artificial precision devices such as heart pacemakers in the body and video cameras are sensitive to magnetic fields .
The development of the maglev railway is entering the stage where efforts will center on improving reliability and reducing costs in the move towards practical use .
The results may lead to a deeper understanding of most of the technical issues and the final evaluation of the maglev railway may become possible .
The ME concept is a program for using magnetic force to levitate and run a train above rails laid on land and in the ocean .
In the experiment , the amount of current through a 10-meter coil on a rail was modulated and the cars were levitated and run by the resulting force of magnetic repulsion between the coil and the permanent magnets on the cars .
With the votes of the coalition , the Bundestag has passed a planning law for the magnetic levitation vehicle link .
It was necessary to pass this law to begin construction of the already agreed upon `` Transrapid `` magnetic levitation vehicle link between Hamburg and Berlin .
The construction of the first stretch of the magnetic levitation link is essential primarily to secure export chances of the technology involved .
On the other hand , the SPD criticized not just the magnetic link itself , but the planning methods used .
Military personnel and railway workers also have frequent recourse to the telephone .
In addition to the power companies -LRB- EVU -RRB- and the former Federal Railway System , the armed forces are also exempted from DBP Telekom 's telephone service monopoly .
The know-how gained by the Stuttgart workers in developing these systems is now becoming an export hit .
But from now on , the main concentration will be on people 's living standards , ' says theJapan Development Bank .
Private consortiums also are developing large commercial and residential ventures in the area .
HSST Corporation of Nagoya is separately promoting three schemes , including an inter-city maglev railway that would cruise at 186mph , a commuter version and a downtown people -mover .
Instead of conventional engines , the Transrapid is propelled by magnetic fields .
It has no wheels and rather than run on conventional railway tracks it clutches a concrete runway rather like the runner on a curtain rail .
The technology dates from the 1920s when Hermann Kemper , an electronic engineer who ran a meat packing business near the present 32km test site in Emsland , began poring over papers about the theory of magnetic levitation .
Conventional magnetic levitation works by using the repellant force of superconductive magnets of opposite polarities .
In the Transrapid , propulsion comes from the force of magnetic attraction .
By passing electrical current through a stator pack , the stationary part of an electric motor which is laid out on the underside of a concrete runway , a wandering magnetic field is created .
This magnetic field - called wandering because it moves down the runway - is attracted or excited by levitation magnets mounted on the underside of the Transrapid , so propelling the vehicle forward .
Because the Transrapid glides above a concrete runway it does not need to overcome the resistance between track and wheels which traditional railway technology still has to grapple with .
The DM5.6 bn -LRB- Pounds 2.3bn -RRB- needed to finance the runway and infrastructure will be put up by the federal government , and Thyssen has created a company together with Lufthansa , the national airline , and Deutsche Bahn , the state railway , which have to find DM4.8 bn to operate the service .
Magnetic-levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway .

Karen Allen heads the cast as schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe .
Karen Allen , best known for her starring role in `` Raiders of the Lost Ark , '' plays McAuliffe .
But Allen was eventually won over because of McAuliffe , the high school teacher and mother from Concord , New Hampshire .
In preparation , Allen spent hours watching and re-watching videos of McAuliffe .
By studying the tapes , Allen said , she was able to capture McAuliffe 's `` rhythm '' -- how she walked , talked , stood and even how she held her head .
By the time Allen arrived at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston last summer to shoot `` Challenger , '' the actress felt a kinship to McAuliffe .
At NASA , Allen worked alongside the same people who knew and worked with McAuliffe .
Allen went through a lot of the same training McAuliffe did , including a pilot training course so she could obtain a special license to fly in the KC-135-the plane that simulates weightlessness .

It takes just one blow of a steamboat whistle on the quay at New Orleans to find yourself transported into the storybook past of the Mississippi paddleboats .
In Life on the Mississippi , Mark Twain wrote that it was every boy 's ambition to be a steamboat man .
Some people prefer the Mississippi Queen with such modern amenities as cinema and pool .
The scenery on the 682-mile round trip from New Orleans to Vicksburg , on the lower Mississippi , is disappointing .
TS Eliot called the Mississippi 'a great brown god ' , and it captivates quickly .
Louisiana was the centre of the plantation economy and the lower Mississippi area is dotted with large , colonnaded houses , built mostly between the late 18th century and the civil war to show off the wealth generated by cotton , indigo , rice and sugar .
During the civil war it was a Confederate stronghold defending the whole of the lower Mississippi .
These , as long as five football fields , tend to take up the whole river as they round bends .
There is so much traffic that the Delta Queen 's jovial Captain John Davitt compares the river to 'driving on an interstate highway ' .
Avoiding these obstacles , and the barges , requires great skill from the river pilots who drive the steamboats .

TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board of Trade will offer a seminar later this month on El Nino , the weather phenomenon that develops in the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and can cause global climate upsets .
Grain traders are keen to know if they can expect this year 's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to make a dent in crop output .
Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating during 1991 , only last month did the the US National Weather Service finally conclude publicly that the phenomenon was a fact .
While many of these conditions indicate that El Nino is occurring , they do not reveal its severity .
Mr Vernon Kousky , a research meteorologist with the US weather service , now assesses the current El Nino as 'moderate to strong ' .
While individual weather events can not always be directly attributed to El Nino , some signals are indicative of its strength .
Mr Kousky says that El Nino , usually a 12 to 18 month event , has another six to 12 months to run .
But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between El Nino and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months .
Crop Cast , a Maryland -based weather forecasting service that is used by many US commodity trading houses , says that while El Nino has already affected South American soyabeans , South African maize and Australian wheat , it is hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effects in the US by looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other climatological events , last year 's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines and the combination of lunar and solar cycles .
These additional factors along with El Nino probably mean that a more extreme weather pattern bleeds over into summer , according to Mr Kevin Marcus , director of Crop Cast services .
He is still waiting for more data on the severity of this year 's El Nino .
In 1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Peruvian fishmeal catch , which then accounted for some 45 per cent of the world trade in protein feed .
El Nino , a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn of the century , could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year , weather forecasters said Friday .
El Nino may bring drought conditions to eastern Australia , where farmers are suffering from falling commodity prices and high interest rates , they said .

The cause of the accident , the second worst in world aviation history , with 264 of the 271 passengers and crew on board killed , remains under investigation .
Both Chairman Liu The-min -LSB- name as received -RSB- and General Manager Yuan Hsing-yuan of China Airlines -LSB- CAL -RSB- on Tuesday -LSB- 31 May -RSB- offered to resign to take responsibility for the CAL airbus crash in Nagoya , Japan on April 6 .
Fu Chun - fan , new president of China Airlines -LRB- CAL -RRB- , said Thursday -LSB- 2 Jun -RSB- that CAL will stress air safety following the CAL plane crash in Japan in April .
Chiang , 68 , said that his top priority will be to deal with the aftermath of the Nagoya plane crash and to step up air safety .
The Chinese mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -LRB- ARATS -RRB- today sent a message to the Taiwan -based Straits Exchanges Foundation -LRB- SEF -RRB- , expressing heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families from Taiwan involved in the crash of a China Airlines Airbus A-300 at Nagoya Airport yesterday .
Li also said the government will take some disciplinary measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday crash .
Earlier in the day , President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan 's ruling Nationalist Party -LRB- Kuomintang -RRB- that a special committee has been set up within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines in the aftermath of the crash .
All but eight of the aircraft 's 271 passengers and crew , mostly Japanese and Taiwanese , were killed in the crash of the Airbus A300- 600R , arriving in Nagoya from Taipei .
It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 11th since 1969 , giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of crashes per flight hours than the world average .
Meanwhile , compensation for the crash is turning out to be a thorny issue for CAL .
Although initial reports have pointed at human error , the true cause of the crash will not be known for two to three months , after an international investigation team completes analysis of the aircraft 's flight and voice recorders .
Sun submitted his resignation in the wake of the April 26 China Airlines ' Airbus crash at Nagoya , Japan .
Masayoshi Takemura , chief cabinet secretary under the Hosokawa cabinet , was also involved in the China Airlines plane case , telling reporters , `` politics is in an unusual stage , but we want to deal with -LRB- the issue -RRB- without delay . ''
A China Airlines aircraft bound from Taipei in Taiwan to Nagoya in western Japan crashed and exploded yesterday in Japan 's second worst airline disaster .
Taiwan 's China Airlines -LRB- CAL -RRB- , under pressure about safety after its worst crash , has banned its pilots from playing mahjong while abroad after they were criticised for living decadent lives , say airline officials .

But there is one valid parallel -- DiMaggio , like Antley , did n't just coast along in 1941 .
One day , though , someone ran a different notion by Dom : A book about 1941 .
If ever the major leagues had a magical , almost mythic year , it was 1941 .
Two months after the 1941 World Series , the Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor .
For a year that had begun so pleasantly , with Dom DiMaggio driving his new Packard cross-country to spring camp , 1941 took increasingly dramatic turns with every page of the calendar .
`` The more I thought about it , the more memories of 1941 came flooding back to me .
`` Still want the book about 1941 ? '' he asked .
Dom can still recall the dinner he had with his older brother in 1941 , after they played on opposite sides when the Boston Red Sox came to Yankee Stadium .
He did , however , go to see old friends such as Williams , Owen , Tommy Henrich , Ken Keltner and others , to jot down their recollections of 1941 .
`` When I hit 56 , I thought I might meet Joe DiMaggio , '' Antley said .
Born about 15 years after the Yankee Clipper 's career ended , Antley thought that DiMaggio was a long-ago jockey until the ballplayer was identified to him a few weeks ago .
Dom DiMaggio , like his brother , likes his privacy .
`` They wanted something about Joe . ''
There was Joe DiMaggio 's 56 -game hitting streak .
It 's out now -- `` Real Grass , Real Heroes , '' -LRB- Zebra , $ 18.95 -RRB- , a collaboration by DiMaggio and author Bill Gilbert that takes us back to a time unlike any other in American history , on and off the ballfields .
Dom DiMaggio did not have any 56 -game hitting streaks , did not marry Marilyn Monroe , did not have any songs written about him , but he did make eight All-Star teams , did play alongside Ted Williams , did play a mean center field .
He was a DiMaggio , all right .
In the field , he played shallow and daringly , the way Tris Speaker had before him or Paul Blair did later .
Joe asked .
`` Well , you might want to back up a few steps , '' Joe said .
`` That 's the last time I give you advice , '' Joe said .
For the book , Dom DiMaggio sought no advice , did not disturb his brother .
Huge contracts and rewards are just part of the changing game to DiMaggio , who detects a brashness in today 's players that did not exist in his day .
For Dom DiMaggio , there is pride in the fact that he batted .298
During part of DiMaggio 's career , sacrifice flies counted as official at-bats .
DiMaggio said : `` No , I 'd have needed a few more hits for .300 . ''

If NBC is successful , the old `` Howdy Doody Show `` will be resurrected -- with David Letterman involved .
`` We have had several conversations with David Letterman and his production staff about doing a new version of 'Howdy Doody ' for Saturday mornings , '' Tartikoff says .
If Letterman agrees , the network is considering the show for fall , 1991 .
The proposed `` Howdy Doody `` revival is part of Tartikoff 's plan to beef up Saturday mornings at a time when network cartoon programs are steadily losing viewers to offerings from cable and independent stations .

Ties between India and Uzbekistan , which date back to ancient years , -LSB- break in reception lasting several seconds -RSB- the visit of the Uzbek president , Mr. Islam A. Karimov .
Besides strengthening cooperation in economic areas , the two countries can launch a joint offensive against fundamentalism and extremism with India playing a greater role in Central Asian region in political fields as well .
India has a special relationship with the countries of the region when Europeans and other countries are to get a foothold .
India had recently extended a credit of $ 10 million for setting up projects with Indian know-how and entrepreneurial participation in Uzbekistan .
Uzbek personnel are being trained in India in disciplines such as diplomacy , banking , management and mass communication .
India 's -LRB- Thapar Group -RRB- is also to set up a cotton yarn plant in Uzbekistan .
This visit is likely to open a new era in India - Uzbekistan links with this Central Asian country creating conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation and encouraging ties with foreign companies , firms and financial institutions .
Fewer Siberian cranes are migrating to their favorite wintering ground in the marshes of western India , and some bird watchers fear that they are being shot down over Afghanistan .
Ornithologists know little about the red-beaked white birds that fly more than 3,100 miles in about one month from their breeding ground in the tundras of western Siberia to Bharatpur in Rajasthan state in western India .
The India -bound flock probably makes only two stopovers -- in Soviet Kazakhstan and in Afghanistan , according to Vladimir Flint , head of the Soviet Union 's Animal Protection Department at the All-Union Research Institute of Nature Conservation and Reserves in Moscow .
Prakash Gole , head of the Ecological Society based in Poona , India , agreed with Harris that Siberian cranes may have been killed in Afghanistan .
The freshwater wasteland at Bharatpur , about 30 miles west of the Taj Mahal in Agra , was declared a shooting preserve for local maharajahs and British colonial rulers in 1902 .
S. K. Lambah , consul general for India , dipping into the shiny concoction .
`` We are an ancient country , '' he said , standing between flags of India and the United States .
In a light vein , I would say the United States and India are two countries separated by the same political system . ''
The United States is India 's largest trading partner .
India was the 10th country in the world to become industrialized .
After the United States and the Soviet Union , India is the world 's largest resource for technological manpower .
`` The real Taj Mahal was built to symbolize a man 's enduring love for his wife , '' said Lambah 's guest , Devender Singh of the India Embassy in Washington .
Police in Agra , 125 miles south of Delhi , said they had arrested 200 people and were keeping four ghettos for Harijans -- the untouchables at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy -- under curfew after the wedding sparked a caste war .
Bridegroom Ram Deen , a Harijan , eventually rode to nearby Panwari village in a police jeep to marry 13-year-old Mundra while the army fought back thousands of enraged Jats , the caste of small landowners , in the village and police confronted thousands of Agra Harijans just outside .
The Taj Mahal is on the market , but it 's not the one in Agra , India .
He has taken a trip around the world to ease his broken heart and she asks him if he saw a sacred elephant in India .
This replica was made by an Agra jeweler .
Part of Pal 's thesis is that nobody thought the building was such a big deal until the British moved into India .
But no big-name European artist was ever magnetized to India in the way Morocco attracted Delacroix or the South Seas seduced Gauguin .
Officials describe the violence as among the worst since India gained independence 43 years ago .
In Agra , also in Uttar Pradesh , police spokesman M. P. Solanki said Monday that at least 11 people have been killed and 28 injured in Hindu - Muslim clashes since Friday .
An indefinite curfew and heavy security kept most people off Agra 's streets , and nearly every shop was boarded up .
They say Muslim invaders razed a temple on Lord Rama 's birthplace in 1528 to build a monument to the Islamic conquest of India .
It is time for Indian businessmen to give up inhibitions and invest in this former Soviet republic known for gas deposits , coal reserves , non-ferrous metals and gold .
The changed global scenario definitely demands Indian businessmen to break the barrier and tap the available opportunities in the land where people also love Indian films and adore Raj Kapoor , the doyen of Indian cinema .
As Mr. Karimov put it after his arrival in New Delhi on Monday , he would not like Indian businessmen to be left behind .
During his meeting with the Indian president , Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma , the Uzbek president said that the disintegration of the Soviet Union had created a vacuum in Central Asian region .
The Uzbek president earlier held formal talks with the Indian prime minister , Mr. P.V .
Narasimha Rao , and discussed bilateral issues with several Indian ministers .
While New Delhi was the first city that Uzbek president , Mr. Karimov , visited outside the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991 after his country decided to break away from the former USSR , Indian Prime Minister Mr. P.V .
Mr. Karimov , accompanied by a delegation from Uzbekistan , including the foreign minister and chairman of board of dealing with trade like industry , economic relations , civil aviation and tourism met leading Indian industrialists and entrepreneurs to explore possible areas of cooperation .
Indian wildlife officials and environmentalists agree with Jim Harris , an ornithologist with the International Crane Foundation based in Baraboo , Wis. , that the birds may be falling victim to gunners in Afghanistan 's war .
A Soviet scientist rejected that theory , and other Indian officials said recurring drought in Bharatpur may be contributing to the declining number of arrivals at the sanctuary .
Singh 's one-day tours cost $ 100 for a Western tour group and $ 7.35 each for Indian groups .
About 100 guests came -LRB- at an ultra-reasonable $ 35 each -RRB- to dabble in Indian food , raise money for the Protocol Foundation and listen to Lambah talk about his country .
It 's a houseboat that looks like a floating Taj , and is the weekend home of Deborah and William Harlan .
The 4 , 500-square-foot houseboat has two domes , instead of one like the Indian landmark , but the cut-out fascia above its entrance was copied from a portal of the original Taj .
`` Romance of the Taj Mahal , '' opening today at the County Museum of Art , is a wondrous exhibition that is at once scholarly , affectionate and generous -- like the Magi bearing exotic gifts for the holidays .
The Taj became one of the world 's most celebrated buildings , not because it is a great historical monument like the pyramids of Giza or the Greek Acropolis , but because of the refinement of its design , the richness of marble and inlay and -- most of all -- the romance that fueled it .
That elephant was surely the Taj .
The exhibition -LRB- through March 11 -RRB- is the brainchild of LACMA 's super- smart senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art , Pratapaditya Pal .
The closest we get to the Taj is through a large model that acts as the exhibition frontispiece .
In 1939 , it came to the New York World 's Fair and was later picked up by an Indian expatriate who used it as the centerpiece for his restaurant in Florida .
Pal 's catalogue introduction concentrates amusingly on modern commercial exploitation such as an advertisement that shows a splendid view of the Taj mirrored in its famous reflecting pool .
The curator has donnish fun pointing out other examples , such as the rock-blues musician who took `` Taj Mahal `` as his nom de microphone .
Now his friends say , `` Hi , Taj `` and headwaiters greet him solemnly as `` Mr. Mahal . ''
The catalogue 's final section is devoted to representations of the Taj mainly by later Europeans .
He wonders out loud whether the romance of the Taj is not largely a Western rather than an Indian phenomenon .
The section proves the point , but in a funny way , because no really substantial Western artist ever messed into the place except Rembrandt , who collected Indian miniatures at a distance .
One is inclined to see the mystification of the Taj as part of the 19th-Century Romantics ' passion for the exotic .
The section fizzles slightly on account of this but underlines the Taj 's charm as being probably as much a popular as an aesthetic phenomenon .
When we set the comparatively clunky Euro - American art next to the ethereal delicacy of original Mogul , one thing is certain : We may love the Taj , but we got her wrong .
When a respected old man is caught en flagrante in bed with a young boy , the shock and humiliation of it are muffled into a rather kindly prank .
It is a pity to have so little architecture in a show about the Taj Mahal .
It 's easy enough for a Western cynic to suspect that both the fact and symbolism of the Taj are not really about romance but about luxury -- an easy mistake to make at the end of the voracious '80s .
Indian visitors from philosophers to plebes have remarked on how the Taj seems weightless and otherworldly .
Soldiers , paramilitary units and police patrolled the streets and stood guard around the Taj Mahal , closed since the fighting broke out .
The huge wooden gates were shut , and an official said it was too dangerous to allow anyone inside the Taj Mahal , built by the Muslim ruler Shah Jehan in memory of his wife .

In nearly every episode , Captain James Kirk proved his manhood by fighting with some unpleasant alien species -LRB- surrogates for the evil Soviet empire -RRB- and falling in love with a beautiful blonde guest star .
The cerebral Captain Jean-Luc Picard has superseded tough- guy Kirk .
In 1967 , a 13-year-old actor named Craig Hundley was cast as Captain Kirk 's nephew in an episode of television 's `` Star Trek . ''
`` It harks back to what I liked best in the old 'Star Trek ' series , and that is the action and the adventure and the interplay between the characters , '' says Shatner , 58 , who co-wrote the script , directed the film and reprised his role as the intrepid James T. Kirk .
Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock made a famous on-camera `` ascent '' of El Capitan in `` Star Trek V. '' Stunt climbers were used for the rock-face scenes , and the two actors , William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy , were helicoptered to the summit for the finale .
TV thus leads children to seek 'quick fixes ' , to want things but not to see they must work for them .
The producers of the popular series Star Trek , to take one example , appear quite responsible .
Back in the late 1960s , the starship Enterprise was run almost exclusively by white males -LRB- there was a token black female communications officer and an Asian helmsman -RRB- and toured the universe seemingly looking for trouble .
Star Trek : the Next Generation -LRB- the 1980s ' relaunch of the series -RRB- shows distinct signs of progress .
Women play a more active role and are no longer treated as mere sex objects ; the ship 's doctor and security officer , for example , are both female .
As in the first series , the Enterprise is subject to the 'prime directive ' - essentially a code of non-interference .
This year a third series - Star Trek : Deep Space Nine - has hit the nation 's screens .
As in previous incarnations of Star Trek , each episode includes plenty of sanitised violence .
Many years later he returned to the `` Star Trek `` saga in a very different role ; now a successful composer in the electronic music field , he supplied some of the eerie sounds in the Klingon sequence of the film `` Star Trek : the Motion Picture . ''
He also worked on the synthesizer programming for parts of `` Star Trek II `` and was involved with the movie series through `` Star Trek V. ``
Enterprise .
One of his more celebrated inventions , heard during those weird interludes in `` Star Trek `` movies , is the Blaster Beam .
Trek Talk : Actor-director William Shatner promises that Trekkies devoted to the original 1966 `` Star Trek `` TV series will find plenty to like about `` Star Trek V : The Final Frontier , '' scheduled for release June 9 .
Shatner says that compared to the other `` Star Trek `` movies , `` this picture is rougher and louder and faster -- there 's more of an energy permeating the film . ''

It was a U.S. decision to withdraw high-level military contacts with New Zealand following introduction of the nuclear policy in 1986 .
New Zealand should stop trying to revive its military alliance with the United States and instead equip itself to work with multinational defence forces in the United Nations , Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Doug Graham said in a speech Monday .
Graham said it was now unlikely the Anzus alliance could be restored and he pointed out that traditional alliances carried risks of dragging unwilling partners into conflicts anyway .
New Zealand could not afford to defend itself alone against sophisticated modern weaponry .
New Zealand faced three choices .
New Zealand will maintain its ban on nuclear-powered and -armed ships from its ports , despite high-level U.S. urging for a change of policy , Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Wednesday .
He told Radio N @ w Zealand a change in the ban was `` not an agenda item '' .
After meeting with Bolger he urged New Zealand to re-think its anti-nuclear stance and consider the benefits of resuming full military ties .
New Zealand hoped the U.S. would reflect on that decision and there would be a greater degree of cooperation in future .
Although a New Zealand government commissioned study had found nuclear propulsion was safe , the public was not willing to accept such ships .
`` Clearly if New Zealand was to change its propulsion laws that would be quite significant in terms of U.S. attitudes , but at the moment the New Zealand parliament is not about to do that , '' Bolger said .
He was `` quite comfortable '' with New Zealand 's current policy .
New Zealanders had told the United States they wanted to work along their own route .
`` That 's been a little difficult for some people but that 's where the New Zealand public is .
And as I say it 's not an agenda item in New Zealand at the present time , '' he said .
New Zealand had a close defence relationship with Australia and had worked in a peacekeeping role with the U.S. in theatres of conflict like the Gulf War and Bosnia .
New Zealand defence forces were becoming increasingly involved with peacekeeping of a higher risk than in the past .
`` I think New Zealanders would accept that and say that 's the defence responsibility New Zealand can and should take up , '' he said .
Recent trading successes , and indications of political goodwill , appear to be breaking down the often intense and historic rivalry between New Zealand and its resource-rich neighbour Australia .
Australians are showing increasing interest in the economic reform programme in New Zealand , although it is acknowledged that political realities make it unlikely that some of the tax and labour regulations will find their way into law there .
Signed in 1982 , CER has been of immense importance to New Zealand .
New Zealanders are pressing Australia to further develop the agreement and move towards a fuller integration of the two economies .
The agreement has allowed Air New Zealand to establish a 'hub ' in Brisbane , to service the Asian market .
However , Australians have been slow to use the 'beyond rights ' that they gained to New Zealand in the reciprocal aviation deal .
New Zealand is anxious to see Ansett flying the Tasman Sea between the two countries .
New Zealand manufacturers operate in a largely tariff-free environment , and can buy raw materials , such as plastic , cheaply on the world market .
This situation appears to benefit New Zealand manufacturers in selling to Australia , as it keeps up the price of Australian inputs .
Rowland Crone , president of the New Zealand Manufacturers ' Federation , says action on these issues is a priority and would further strengthen CER trade and economic ties .
New Zealand officials are also keen to see freer trade between the two blocs .
However , Mr Crone argues that to compete equably with the dynamic Asean countries , New Zealand and Australia must settle the remaining outstanding issues between them over CER .
Since last year , relations have improved , following a state visit to New Zealand by Mr Keating , who appears to have developed an excellent relationship with the New Zealand prime minister , Jim Bolger .
However , the Australians continue to keep a close eye on New Zealand .
There were grumbles in New Zealand after Australia 's April budget : many people complained that it contained a tax incentive measure that was expressly aimed at encouraging companies to base their head offices and manufacturing facilities in Australia rather than New Zealand .
This followed moves to New Zealand by a string of companies , to take advantage of the lower tax , cost and wage structure .
Among companies moving to New Zealand , or expanding there , were Gillette , Unilever , Johnson & Johnson and Alcatel , which supplies wiring systems for the Australian car industry .
All use New Zealand as a base to supply Australia and Asia .
A recent study by Trust Bank found that major companies were coming to New Zealand because of its low inflation .
It found that costs were being held as industry developed flexibility , and said productivity of New Zealand industry had risen by 28 per cent in the five years to last December , using no more staff or overtime hours .
A number of New Zealand companies are expanding in Australia .
They include Pacific Star , a subsidiary of Telecom New Zealand , which is a major supplier to telecommunications equipment to the Queensland government and larger companies ; and the white-goods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel , which has built a large plant in Queensland .
The growth of sales to Australia has been a factor in the surge of optimism seen recently among New Zealand manufacturers .
In the year to December 31 , the strengthening New Zealand economy led to the creation of 42,000 jobs , of which 23,000 were fulltime positions in manufacturing .
Yet all is not going New Zealand 's way .
Against this , New Zealanders have done well in light engineering and steel and aluminium fabrication .
It is widely believed that any advantages New Zealand manufacturers have gained are due to efficiencies learned the hard way , through surviving a protracted and deep recession .
The talks also covered a threat this week by New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange to pull out of the ANZUS defense alliance linking his country with Australia and the United States .
Officials said both sides want New Zealand to remain in ANZUS , but the United States will not change its position of wanting its ships to visit New Zealand without preconditions .
While there , will also meet with Nick Greiner , premier of New South Wales .
Voters booted out New Zealand 's Labor Party on Saturday , humiliating Prime Minister Mike Moore and giving the opposition National Party the biggest election victory in more than half a century .
The Bush Administration , reaffirming the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence , rebuffed an Australian call for a resumption of close political and military ties with New Zealand , senior officials of both countries said today .
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it is time for Washington to consider repairing the relationship with New Zealand that was downgraded two years ago after the Wellington government refused to permit nuclear armed or nuclear-powered U.S. warships to call at New Zealand ports , an Australian official said .
A senior Bush Administration official said the breach was caused by New Zealand 's anti-nuclear policy .
New Zealand 's new prime minister , Jeffrey Palmer , has reaffirmed his nation 's anti-nuclear policy .
But he complained that President Bush is prepared to meet Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev while retaining a policy that prohibits high-level political and military contacts with New Zealand , one of Washington 's oldest traditional allies .
For years , the U.S. government has expressed concern that a growing worldwide abhorrence of nuclear weapons might upset the global military balance which , officials argue , has prevented a new world war for almost 45 years .
The disagreement over New Zealand , combined with a somewhat similar rift over Washington 's continued coolness toward an Australian -backed South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone , marred otherwise harmonious U.S. - Australia security talks at a naval base in Sydney .

At the present pace , District of Columbia homicides would exceed 600 for the year .
An anguished District of Columbia is America 's newly crowned murder capital .
The moral authority of Washington 's mayor , Marion Barry , has been undermined by allegations that he uses cocaine and associates with drug dealers .
With Washington 's unwanted national notoriety came even more murders .
Last year 90 % of the victims and 80 % of the suspects in Washington 's murders were black , and one-fifth of the suspects were 18 or 19 .
Washington 's most troublesome crime problem is drug-related murders .
WASHINGTON

The new funding for the District of Columbia will seek to ease strains on overcrowded jails and overburdened police in an effort to rid the streets of the drug offenders whose turf wars have transformed the city into the nation 's murder capital .
Prosecutors and other law enforcement personnel in the District of Columbia long have complained about a lack of prison space and a lack of progress toward construction of a new federal prison for which Congress already has appropriated $ 50 million .
The Administration plan seeks to remedy that problem by transferring 250 already-sentenced prisoners from the District of Columbia jail to facilities elsewhere in the federal system , thus opening jail space to defendants arrested in the stepped-up drive against drug violators .
In addition , cases subject to the death penalty under sweeping anti-drug legislation approved by Congress last year also may be prosecuted by federal authorities rather than by the District of Columbia , where there is no capital punishment .
The most far-reaching plan , already adopted in Virginia and now scheduled for the District of Columbia , would allow HUD to speed evictions of individuals convicted of drug-related criminal offenses by denying them the right to appeal those evictions to an administrative board .
Five District of Columbia residents , including a 13-year-old girl , were killed within seven hours during a night of violence that ended just before dawn Sunday , police reported .
In the most far-reaching gun control action ever taken in the United States , District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry announced Tuesday that he had signed a bill that makes manufacturers and sellers legally liable for deaths and injuries caused by the most fearsome assault weapons .
Under a special review process that applies only to District of Columbia laws , Congress may veto the controversial gun control measure .
District of Columbia police say that nearly all of the guns used in crimes here were brought into the city from neighboring Maryland or Virginia , where gun laws are far less stringent .
Supporters of the law hope to bottle it up in the District of Columbia Committee , headed by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums -LRB- D - Berkeley -RRB- , who is usually a strong proponent of home rule for Washington .
Rohrabacher , a member of the House District of Columbia Committee , was traveling in the Middle East and could not be reached for comment .
Five fatal shootings in a 24-hour period made January the deadliest month ever in the nation 's capital as Washington recorded 49 homicides .
The District last year recorded 372 homicides , surpassing Detroit for the highest murder rate in the country .
Fulwood last week said the city 's raging drug trade continues to be responsible for most of the gunplay .
In blighted brick housing projects and row houses just minutes from the grand marble buildings that represent the seat of national government , a city 's obsession with cheap , addictive crack cocaine flares out of control .
New Murder Capital
Its homicide rate has more than doubled in less than 15 months .
By Friday there had been 120 killings already this year in a city of only 650,000 .
Washington these days is the subject of much the same unwanted national attention for its crack wars that Los Angeles received in 1988 for its street gang wars .
But while Los Angeles ' gang murders are a long-term problem that popped into the nation 's consciousness last year when two South-Central Los Angeles gangs took their violence to fashionable Westwood Village , the crack wars of Washington have exploded with shocking speed .
And while Los Angeles ' biggest homicide problem remains murders that grow out of a deeply embedded street psychosis , in which the murder of innocents is rationalized by gang rivalries , Washington is seized by a raw economic struggle among local and out-of-town drug distributors and independent street dealers .
The battle is over the right to use thousands of vacant lots , apartment courtyards and alleys to sell the small $ 10 and $ 20 chunks of crack cocaine to an increasingly frenzied clientele that comes not only from the inner city but from the suburbs of Virginia and Maryland .
Adjacent suburban areas are also experiencing record murder rates .
Ironically , the fact that Washington does not have an entrenched network of street gangs like Los Angeles is one of the reasons that crack has caused so much bloodshed here , according to law enforcement sources .
The violence that grows out of this business climate has given Washington a per-capita rate of drug-related killings that is more than five times Los Angeles ' rate of gang killings .
Frustrated U.S. senators have threatened to fill the void by imposing federal control over the city 's police force .
And new federal drug czar William J. Bennett has promised to make the district a `` test case '' in the government 's war on drugs , suggesting that he will deploy federal agents to `` secure the perimeter '' and allow the city 's residents to reclaim the streets .
From 1982 to 1985 they fell 50 % , to 148 , a per-capita rate about equal to today 's rate in Los Angeles .
In January , statistics showed that last year 's per-capita murder rate -- 58 per 100,000 citizens -- narrowly edged out a grateful Detroit , the previous title- holder .
Los Angeles , with a per-capita rate of 24 per 100,000 , experienced a 12 % drop in homicides last year even though its gang murders were rising by 25 % .
In the same way that Los Angeles police conducted massive sweeps of suspected gang members last year , Washington police have arrested 46,000 people in the last two years in sweeps of drug-selling sites .
As was the case 21 years ago , when riots broke out in poor Washington neighborhoods in the wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's assassination , there is a sobering proximity between the Capitol and the crack wars , which are fought only one to three miles away .
At day 's end , the poor , most of them black , migrate to the city 's northeast , southeast and southwest quadrants .
The wealthy head the other way , to the tree-lined streets and $ 300,000 homes of northwest Washington west of Rock Creek Park .
Travel agents assure convention planners that Washington is still a nice place to visit .
Washingtonian magazine printed its first editorial in 24 years , proclaiming : `` This is still a good city . ''
And a defensive Barry has urged the federal government to spend its time and money wiping out coca crops in South America and to stay out of his city 's business .
`` To suggest that the city is under siege is not an accurate reading , '' said H. H. Brookins , bishop of the district 's African Methodist Episcopal churches , who came here last year after serving as AME bishop in Los Angeles .
More than anywhere else , Washington is a wrenching reminder that homicide is the nation 's leading cause of death for black males between 15 and 34 .
And , as happened in Washington , residents complained bitterly to police about dealers on the streets .
Because crack can be sold in Washington for twice the price it brings in New York , cocaine suppliers and free-lance dealers from New York , many of them Jamaicans with notorious reputations for violence , have swarmed to the district , frequently clashing with local dealers .
The rings in Washington filter the drug down through a network of lieutenants , who are normally in charge of breaking a kilo or two of cocaine a week into smokable `` rock '' form and cutting deals with hundreds of street dealers .
In northeast Washington , police said , a street dealer named JoJo was `` fronted '' 10 small packs of crack by another dealer named Angie , who worked for a lieutenant named Earl .
Last weekend Headen sat in his living room in a pleasant neighborhood in northwest Washington , where there are no street dealers , and thought about another boy who could go either way .
Billionaire H. Ross Perot , saying the nation 's capital has some of the nation 's worst schools , urged local business leaders Tuesday to pitch in and help fight the city 's murder , drug and crime epidemic .
Perot , a colorful and controversial Texas businessman , spoke to more than 500 Washington-area business leaders who support the Salvation Army at the charitable group 's annual district luncheon .
In outlining the plan , Bennett harshly denounced city officials for an `` irresponsibility .
The selection of Washington for the first major assault should not be taken as a signal that `` other cities are going to be ignored , '' Bennett said .
Washington Mayor Marion Barry told reporters Monday that he welcomes federal assistance and the `` idea of Washington being a model '' in programs to fight drugs .
In the longer term , the plan calls for two new jail and prison facilities in the Washington area to be completed within two years .
They will include a 500 -bed pretrial detention facility on excess federal land and a 700 -bed federal correctional institution to serve the Washington - Baltimore area .
The bureau is to set up a central database to catalogue rapidly increasing homicides in the city as part of a program designed to apprehend the most violent criminals .
There were 372 homicides reported in Washington last year , and the city 's 58 murders per 100,000 citizens was the highest rate in the nation .
Administration officials said , however , that the Guard almost certainly will be enlisted to assist law enforcement officers with administrative duties and might also help to patrol city streets .
U.S. to Take Some Cases
In an attempt to ensure that drug traffickers are subject to stringent penalties , the officials said , U.S. Atty .
Jay B. Stephens will transfer `` appropriate cases '' from the local court to U.S. District Court , where federal laws calling for mandatory prison terms can be invoked .
Despite its broad scope , the plan stopped short of declaring Washington a `` high-intensity drug trafficking area , '' a designation that could have given the Administration power to marshal even more sweeping federal resources .
`` There is a special relationship between Washington and the federal government , and I think most Americans understand that , '' Bennett said , explaining the choice of the city for the first major drug assault .
He said the government was acting on a `` kind of emergency basis '' in Washington `` to see what we can learn '' about future anti-drug efforts .
In Los Angeles , Gary Squier , who took over Monday as acting director of the troubled Los Angeles City Housing Authority , said the authority had not taken a position on waiving the administrative appeals procedure .
Squier said the authority would need federal funding to beef up its existing police force in the city 's 21 public housing complexes but rejected the proposed identification card scheme as unfeasible .
Washington assumed the unofficial title as the nation 's murder capital in 1988 when it recorded 369 homicides , highest per capita for any major U.S. city .
The killings pushed the city 's homicide toll to 369 , equal to last year 's record .
They occurred in four separate incidents in different sections of the city , police said .
Although police initially had reported 372 killings in the city during 1988 , they later revised the total , saying that three of the incidents had been classified as justifiable homicides .
Among the nation 's largest cities , Washington had the highest per-capita murder rate in 1988 .
About $ 11,000 in cash and a large quantity of heroin were found in Broome 's clothing , police said .
The measure had been passed last week by the City Council .
accused the city government of `` cheap theatrics '' and predicted that the measure will not stand up in court .
Although it already has one of the stiffest gun control laws on the books , Washington has the highest homicide rate in the nation , with a record 465 murders so far this year .
City Council 's actions , but once measures become controversial they usually are turned down .
`` The city of Washington has far overstepped its bounds in trying to put gun -LRB- firms that -RRB- make assault weapons out of business , '' Dykema said .

The Polonaise from Tchaikovsky 's opera Eugene Onegin was a brief but cracking opener and its brilliant bluster was no sooner in our ears than forcibly contradicted by the bleak depression of Shostakovich 's second cello concerto , Op .
The new work on this occasion was Gerhard Schedl 's Second Piano Trio , subtitled 'Lamento ' , which takes the music of the two Armed Men from Mozart 's Die Zauberflote and sets isolated phrases from it afloat in a sea of vaguely expressionist sounds : not a piece of strong individual merit , although at 10 minutes it did not outstay its welcome .
Shostakovich 's invention is not perhaps of the most distinguished in this work , which is just a very good performance 'on the Shostakovich ' ; but Harrell read in a marvellous intensity everywhere and the orchestra answered Kreizberg 's evident commitment with a high-tension accompaniment notable for individual excellences -LRB- the sturdy peculiar horn calls at the end of the first movement , the split -second demented xylophone interjections of the scherzo -RRB- as well as formidable group cohesiveness .

Taxol is now being tested against ovarian and breast cancers .
The US National Cancer Institute first discovered taxol in the 1960s but saw its natural products program languish in the 1980s .
The controversy surrounding taxol has underscored the issue of supply .
Bristol-Myers has received permission to market taxol to women with ovarian cancer who have failed to respond to chemotherapy .
Taxol is being studied for a number of other cancer uses including breast , lung and head and neck cancers .
AN advisory panel of the US Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- yesterday recommended marketing approval for the drug Taxol to treat ovarian cancer which does not respond to standard treatment , writes Karen Zagor in New York .
Morphine is derived from opium , for example , and penicillin is a fungal metabolite .
James McChesney , director of the Research Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Mississippi estimates the compound generates as much as Dollars 300m a year in sales in Europe .
The drug is an analog of campotothecin , a compound extracted from trees in China and India .
The company is studying analogs of the compound and it is searching for new plant medicines as part of a research consortium with the University of Illinois in Chicago , one of the leading academic centres involved in medicinal plants .
Another promising product is artemisinin , an antimalarial drug originally derived from a plant found in China and south-east Asia , according to McChesney .
'The excitement is that the compound is effective for drug -resistant malaria and is practically a miraculous drug for cerebral malaria , a serious form of the disease , ' he said .
Artemesia annua , from which the compound is derived , is a 'worldwide naturalised weed , ' said McChesney .
'By using traditional knowledge there is greater likelihood of yielding an active compound or a pharmaceutical , ' said Lisa Conte , Shaman 's president .
Shaman is the traditional name for 'medicine man ' .
One is an anti-viral drug against respiratory infections ; the second is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent derived from a plant used by native tribes in North America and Africa for the treatment of infections .
Conte claimed that by using traditional medicines , Shaman 's 'hit rate ' - the number of times screening finds a compound with activity against a certain target - is 'one in two extracts versus the mass screening process in large pharmaceutical companies which is one in thousands ' .

Today it is a semi-boom town of some 30,000 souls who race around in huge tax-free Jeeps and , together with the wealthy cruise ship passengers passing through on their way to Antarctica , do a roaring trade in the bars and liquor shops .
Jagged peaks soar above the bay and encircle the town in a snowy embrace .
He spotted the campfires of the Yahgan Indian inhabitants and named it Tierra del Humo : the Land of Smoke .
At midnight one can read a paperback by natural light and the town is just beginning to bop .
It is a good town in which to indulge in one of Argentina 's gastronomic highlights , the parrillada - a selection of meat grilled over an open fire .
There is a glacier on the peak at the back of the town , the path to it strewn with alpine flowers : saxifrage , house leeks , tiny yellow drumstick primulas , nodding Icelandic poppies .

One is Lou Gehrig , 2,130 .
And how did this accident come to Laffit , 43 ?
`` I have played baseball , '' he recalls .
If Lyle , a baseball player , went out playing basketball , Norm Nixon , a basketball player , went out playing baseball .
In the World Series that year , he started three games for the Red Sox .
He busts up a knee so severely that he is able to win but six games the following season and just about schusses his way out of baseball .
We asked him one day if , at the top of his baseball career , he had regrets going skiing .
Opinion : What are we counting here , consecutive games scored in or consecutive games played in ?
For example , Gretzky , then an Edmonton Oiler , actually scored in 60 consecutive games , since he had at least one point in each of the last nine games of the 1982-83 season , before getting one in each of the first 51 games of 1983-84 .
When Orel Hershiser threw 59 consecutive scoreless innings at the end of the 1988 season , that was n't the end of it .
What if Lemieux had scored in the last 50 games of this season ?
At the last inspection , made at the end of the 1989 season , Mr. Cal Ripken Jr. performs in his 1 , 250th consecutive game in the sport of rounders .
That is an awful lot of consecutive games , proof of which is only two others in the majors have pulled off more .
The other is Everett Scott , who , at 148 pounds , rolls out of Bluffton , Ind. , to play shortstop for the Red Sox and Yankees and logs 1,307 consecutive games .
In roughly 5 1/2 years , Ripken could be passing Gehrig .
Do you read , for instance , that Wade Boggs is going to play ?
The streak of Steve Garvey , fourth longest in baseball history , came to a finish not when a rabbit slid into Garvey , but when he slid into a catcher .
At least the American League East produced baseball 's only pennant race last season .
George Bell , at 30 , is the last remaining member of what was once projected as baseball 's best outfield .
So could be rookie outfielder Greg Vaughn -LRB- 26 HR , 92 RBIs in 110 games at Class AAA Denver -RRB- .
Olson -LRB- 1.69 ERA , 27 saves -RRB- did not blow an opportunity until late in the season .
The Yankees led the majors in victories during the 1980s , even though it was the first decade since Ruth & Gehrig in which they did not win a World Series .
The Indians have not finished within 10 games of first place since 1959 .
Alan Trammell slumped to .243 and Lou Whitaker hit just .251 .
On June 2 , 1925 , Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig .
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago , on May 2 , 1939 , he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball immortality .
In the 13 full seasons he played , Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season .
The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 straight games by Everett Scott , 823 games -LRB- more than five seasons -RRB- short of Gehrig 's mark .
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989 , he would have to play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig .
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from Sept. 3 , 1975 , to July 29 , 1983 .
Garvey retired after the 1987 season , but if he had kept the streak going in 1983 and was playing today , he would still be a few games short .
`` I do n't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig 's record , '' Garvey said .
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive games .
He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig .
A star at Columbia University , Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed with the Yankees when offered a $ 1,500 bonus .
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924 , Gehrig started his streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp , who had been the Yankees ' first baseman since 1915 , told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to take the day off .
Gehrig took over at first base , and stayed there for 15 years .
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 RBIs .
While million-dollar numbers by today 's standards , it was far below his norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees .
Gehrig , whose top salary was $ 39,000 , had a sluggish spring training in 1939 and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong .
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to the bag .
Murphy told the Iron Horse , `` nice play , '' but Gehrig knew it was nothing special .
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939 , Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one RBI .
Gehrig knew something was wrong , he just did n't know what .
May 1 , 1939 , was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit hotel room .
The next day , Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy : `` I 'm taking myself out of the lineup . ''
`` I decided last Sunday night on this move , '' Gehrig said in announcing his decision to the press .
It would not be fair to the boys , to Joe or to the baseball public for me to try going on .
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be back soon .
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
There was a real Lou Gehrig .
Others have had great numbers , but few more impact on the game of baseball .
`` I remember the first time I played first base at Yankee Stadium thinking I was in the same place Lou Gehrig played , '' first baseman Don Mattingly said .
Yankee Stadium is the `` House that Ruth Built , '' but as long as a team plays there , Gehrig will be the pride of the Yankees .
Coach Bill Snyder , taking over a program that has won two games in the last three years , has decided that the snarling Willie the Wildcat insignia looked `` a little bit like a kitten , '' according to Manhattan artist Tom Brookwalter .
Gehrig never played in another game .
Perspective : Nolan Ryan long ago eclipsed Walter Johnson 's strikeout total , a record that used to be regarded as a baseball standard , much as Babe Ruth 's home run record was .
Dave Anderson of the New York Times did some figuring and discovered that Ryan 's 4,824 strikeouts -LRB- and counting -RRB- compare to Johnson 's 3,508 this way .
Soon thereafter , Gehrig was discovered to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the incurable ailment now known as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
Gehrig was 35 in 1938 .
Re -lighting the flame : When Seattle acquired pitcher Mike Dunne from Pittsburgh last week , the Mariners became the first team in the majors with three members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball team .
`` I did about 100 pushups and about 16 laps in the outfield because I did n't expect to play , '' Stone said .
She also said she did not know of any problem Leach might have .
Oakland 6 , Baltimore 1 -- At Baltimore , Mike Moore allowed four hits in seven innings and Terry Steinbach extended his hitting streak to 15 games , longest in the majors this season , as the Athletics handed the Orioles their fifth consecutive loss .
The A 's have won 31 of their last 48 games in AL East ballparks .
Meanwhile , it was the 1 , 118th consecutive game played by the Orioles ' Cal Ripken , who moved past Billy Williams into fourth place on the all-time list .
The leaders in consecutive games played :
`` Now we can relax and play some baseball , '' Merrill said .
`` It 's a streak of consecutive years of playing every game , not a streak of 1,300 games . ''
Oakland 3 , Kansas City 2 -- Bob Welch settled down after a shaky start to win his sixth consecutive decision and the Athletics completed a three-game sweep at Oakland .
The Royals lost their sixth in a row and fell 16 games behind the American League West -leading Athletics .
Oakland won for the fifth time in six games and improved to 38-17 , the best record in baseball .
`` I 've seen quite a few games with 10 - or 12 -run innings , but it 's something you do n't see every day , '' Wilson said .
Cal Ripken Jr. has the second -longest playing streak in major league baseball , yet the Baltimore Orioles ' shortstop has received as much criticism as acclaim .
Ripken played in his 1 , 308th consecutive game Tuesday night at Baltimore in a game in which Randy Milligan hit his 10th home run leading off the 10th inning to give the Orioles a 4 - 3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers .
Ripken passed Everett Scott for the No. 2 spot in longevity behind Lou Gehrig .
Maybe , if by some stroke of luck I catch Gehrig , then that will really be something . ''
But I never did understand the meaning of the streak and all the attention that has been poured into it . ''
The White Sox , who had won four in a row , are two games behind Oakland in the West .
CONSECUTIVE GAMES PLAYED
I guess the most telling argument for the advisability of playing in pain is the Lou Gehrig story .
Fellow named Lou Gehrig .
Wally Pipp drifted out of the league and out of baseball .
Mrs. Lou Gehrig , herself , was later to claim there was really nothing seriously wrong with Wally Pipp that day except he was n't hitting and thought the day off might do him some good .
He became Baseball 's Fabulous Invalid .
said Baseball .
Did you say `` wart ? ``
He occasionally skipped games or took himself out of the lineup after an inning in pain .
So it is ironic that one of the best explanations of that Japanese approach to fighting a war comes in a book on the game of baseball , `` You Got ta Have Wa -LRB- team harmony -RRB- '' by Robert Whiting .
In Whiting 's book , baseball is everything to the Japanese , including war .
The topic of Japanese baseball is probably not a particularly compelling one to many readers , including even the most avid sports fan .
To the American at the corner bar , swilling beer while watching the Cubs and Cards from Wrigley Field and reading the box scores from the morning sports section , Japanese baseball is something played by a bunch of light-hitting Asians and a handful of Americans in the twilight of their careers .
But Whiting turns this scenario into a fascinating collection of anecdotes that , in the end , adds up to a nicely researched and written book that goes beyond the games and the cliches and into some intriguing sports sociology .
Baseball kamikaze , apparently .
And he ends up with a picture of a Japanese culture so built around face-saving and group -think -- not to mention an American baseball culture built around ego and greed -- that it is a wonder the two cultures can even come close to co-existing in a game that has readily available weapons such as bats and balls .
Their son 's death , while tragic , was also honorable in the context of what baseball symbolizes to the Japanese populace .
Just past the midpoint of a season in which the Dodgers are shakily defending a World Series championship , baseball 's best teams might be the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants .
`` I think baseball is more interesting now than ever , and the clubs today are better balanced than they were 30 or 40 years ago , but there has only been one great team in the last quarter century . ''
On top are two Yankee machines , the 1926- 27-28 clubs with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig , and the multiple champions of the 1930s and early '40s , the players who won so many pennants and World Series that they inspired an American League war cry : `` Break up the Yankees . ''
The overriding irony of baseball in this century , Patterson said , is the increasingly high quality of the modern game combined with the possibility that there wo n't be another team to compare with those now in the top 10 .
`` Free agency and the draft have made it a new game , '' he said , mentioning the revolutionary baseball changes that took root in the 1970s , tearing apart , among others , Finley 's Oakland champions .
`` Baseball has never been so well played .
Baseball could easily expand again .
Today , every baseball roster is stronger , down through the 23rd or 24th man , than they used to be . ''
He and his wife , residents of Fullerton , have five children , 15 grandchildren and a great grandchild , most of them baseball fans .
Along with most old-timers , Patterson ranks the 1927 Yankees as the century 's No. 1 ballclub , in large part because Ruth hit his 60 home runs that year , and Gehrig hit 47 and batted in 175 runs .
`` In 1927 , the Yankees won 110 games in a 154 -game season .
For the second of many times , first baseman Gehrig played every game .
By contrast there was a rookie reliever , Wilcy Moore , who in his only big season in baseball had a 19-7 record with a 2.28 earned-run average in 50 appearances .
Ruth came back to hit 54 home runs in 1928 , when he and Gehrig led the league with 142 runs batted in apiece .
`` Gehrig was still a force on the club when the Yankees started another streak under -LRB- Manager -RRB- Joe McCarthy , and this time they won pennants in 1932 , '36 , '37 , '38 , '39 , '41 , '42 and '43 .
`` Baseball had never seen such a dominant team .
Red Ruffing -LRB- 21-7 -RRB- matched his peak season on a staff with four other pitchers who each won 12 or 13 games -- Atley Donald , Lefty Gomez , Bump Hadley and Monte Pearson .
`` The most poignant of baseball stories began one night in the spring of 1939 when Joe McCarthy walked in to talk to the writers in the dining room of the Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit .
Lou Gehrig has asked to come out of the lineup . '
Even with Babe Dahlgren instead of Gehrig at first base , that became the greatest Yankee team of my time .
`` So the 1974 A 's were baseball 's last great team .
Finley , who did much of the scouting himself , helped round up a group that won a record five straight division championships for Oakland starting in 1971 .
The string only ended in 1976 when the entrepreneurial era ended in baseball as the draft and free agency took hold , balancing up the teams .
In fact they won pennants and three World Series in three consecutive years , in addition to winning five straight division titles .
Hunter , Ken Holtzman and John -LRB- Blue Moon -RRB- Odom won the last three straight that October , after which neither the A 's nor baseball was ever the same .
Relief star Rollie Fingers appeared in a league-leading 76 games in 1974 , and in three years averaged 20 saves .
`` Casey , I feel , has been under-appreciated as a baseball man .
He was n't just the most colorful baseball character of the last 50 years , he lived the game 24 hours a day .
One of the other pall bearers saw it at the same time I did and whispered , 'I see Casey 's at it already . '
`` Usually , baseball players straggle out two or three at a time -- but not those Yankees .
1955 DODGERS : After losing five World Series to the Yankees in '41 , '47 , '49 , '52 , and '53 , the Dodgers , then in Brooklyn , lost the first two games of the '55 Series .
1907 CHICAGO CUBS : Baseball 's first great team , with Manager Frank Chance , the Peerless Leader , at first base , won consecutive pennants and two World Series in 1906-07-08 .
On the 1907 team , a four -straight World Series winner , the answer to baseball 's most enduring trivia question was Harry Steinfeldt .
When he took the field against the Toronto Blue Jays at Memorial Stadium , Ripken did n't set a record , but he established a baseball endurance standard unequaled in the last half century .
With Thursday night 's game , Ripken moved past Steve Garvey into third place on baseball 's all-time list , leaving only Everett Scott -- and 922 games -- between him and Gehrig .
The debate over the advisability of Ripken 's streak has subsided considerably since his streak of 8,243 consecutive innings was stopped two years ago , when his father , Cal Ripken Sr. , the Orioles ' manager at the time , decided it was creating too much attention .
Ripken long ago learned to explain his durability by insisting his string of games was nothing more than a series of 162 -game streaks .
Amazingly , Ripken , who turns 29 next Thursday , recovered and it was n't until 1987 that his streak of consecutive innings was halted , as much to stem the publicity as anything else .
`` I do n't play games because of the streak , '' said Ripken .
Ripken was asked if he could perceive himself playing just to keep The Streak alive -LRB- something even Gehrig did on occasion -RRB- .
To put Gehrig 's streak , and what Ripken already has accomplished , into perspective , consider that Ripken will own the third longest streak in baseball history when he plays one more game .
To catch Gehrig he would have to put together another streak that would be the equivalent of the seventh longest in history .
Nobody knows , of course , whether the Baltimore Oriole shortstop can catch the Iron Horse , but if he does , he will be younger than Gehrig was when Gehrig 's remarkable streak ended .
Gehrig was 35 when he stepped out of the Yankee lineup .
Either they were getting busted up or were sent home because they did little else but run in the ring .

The 110 -story Sears Tower in Chicago is the world 's tallest building .
Yukihisa Tokunaga , a city planning official of the Construction Ministry , said the 500 -story building is one of a number of private plans by major construction firms to meet Tokyo 's growing need for office and apartment space .
The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000 people .
The building is shaped like a triangle , becoming smaller at the top to help it absorb shock waves .
It would have a number of tunnels to let typhoon winds pass through rather than hitting the building with full force .
In the early 1960s , Japan developed a technique of building flexible structures to replace the rigid construction techniques favored for decades .
Under the old concept , engineers built structures of up to 11 stories , using ferroconcrete solid pillars and walls to absorb shock and sustain the building 's weight .
Using the new method , Tokyo 's 36 -story , 482-foot-tall Kasumigaseki Building was completed in 1968 .

At the same time , Australia imported 11.8 billion dollars worth of goods from Japan , resulting in a trade surplus of 3.8 billion dollars .
Exports to the East Asia region , including Japan , Korea , China , Hong Kong and Taiwan , and the Association of South East Asian Nations -LRB- ASEAN -RRB- -- Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , the Philippines and Thailand -- increased by eight percent to 37 billion dollars .
Australia 's total merchandise trade rose by 10 percent in current dollar terms to 125 billion dollars , with eight percent export growth and a 12 percent increase in imports , the report said .
It attributed the fall in the surplus to a decline in the terms of trade , associated with continued weakness in world commodity prices , increased demand for imports flowing from the relatively strong @ rate of domestic recovery and subdued economic activity in a number of key export markets .
A statement released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan 's office said the figures clearly indicated the government 's closer integration with Asia was paying dividends in the form of increased export earnings .

Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The African National Congress -LSB- ANC -RSB- on Thursday -LSB- 14 April -RSB- demanded the immediate withdrawal of the visa of visiting American David Duke , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan and avowed right-winger .
Mr Duke , a former U.S. congressional candidate , arrived in South Africa on Tuesday on a private visit .
South Africans did not need Mr Duke , the ANC said , adding that he should not be given time on radio or television to air his `` noxious '' views .
Delegates at the statewide convention picked state Sen. Ben Bagert over Secretary of State Fox McKeithen , state Rep. Quentin Dastugue of Metairie and Duke , also of Metairie .
He was followed by Dastugue with 183 , McKeithen with 99 and Duke with 52 .
Duke , 39 , won no more than 50 delegates at the caucuses and party officials said previously that he had little support among party regulars .
Letters emphasizing Bush 's endorsement of Republican businessman John Treen in his state House race against David Duke were circulated throughout the district , and radio commercials featuring Reagan 's voice were broadcast throughout the day .
Duke led a field of seven candidates with 33 % of the vote in the Jan. 21 primary .
Bush and Reagan did not mention Duke in their endorsements , but state and national Republican officials made it clear that a Duke victory would harm the party .
`` It has to be political favors being called in , '' Duke said after Treen received the presidential endorsements .
Duke , 38 , publisher of a newspaper for the National Assn .
`` This election is the greatest political upset in Louisiana history , maybe in American history , '' Duke said .
Treen , a Metairie home builder and brother of the state 's former governor , David Treen , called Duke `` a disaster for our area . ''
The usually run-of-the-mill election drew worldwide coverage after the controversial Duke surprised political observers by changing his party affiliation last December and entering a seven -man primary , capturing 33 % of the vote to Treen 's 19 % .
`` David Duke is not a Republican , '' Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater said in a statement released by the party Saturday night .
Party officials in Washington said that if Duke is certified the winner , Atwater will hold an executive meeting of the Republican National Committee to consider a motion of censure that was called `` the political equivalent of excommunication . ''
The motion would condemn Duke and deny him any form of party aid or assistance .
Many other political and civic leaders also opposed Duke .
Treen 's campaign sought to remind the voters of Duke 's past as a neo- Nazi follower of George Lincoln Rockwell and as the imperial wizard of a branch of the klan .
In New Orleans , the Roman Catholic archbishop urged voters not to vote for Duke , while the president of Loyola University dispatched 785 letters to alumni in the district suggesting that they not vote for Duke .
But Duke supporters said that Reagan and Bush , who received more than 80 % of the vote here in their presidential campaigns , were out of their element in this campaign .
`` The people saw through the slime and the sham being spewed forth by our competition , '' said Howie Farrell , Duke 's campaign manager .
Saturday 's election was Duke 's latest foray into politics .
Duke , 38 , and Treen , 63 , have battled for a month to represent the almost all-white district in Metairie , a New Orleans suburb with about 21,000 voters .
Fearing a Duke victory and an embarrassment for the GOP , President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan threw their considerable weight behind Treen , a longtime party functionary .
`` I think we 're going to have a very fine victory , '' Duke said .
Duke won 33 % of the vote to lead a field of seven in the Jan. 21 primary .
It is an era that Duke claimed to be sorry for , but Treen said he did not believe that .
people might think I 'm racially or religiously intolerant , '' Duke said .
Duke left the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980 , accused by another leader of selling secret membership rolls .
The final days of the race brought renewed charges that Duke still was associated with right-wing extremists , including ex- American Nazi leader Ralph Forbes of Arkansas .
Duke acknowledged that Forbes had been campaign manager in his 1988 bid for the presidency as a member of the Populist Party .
The motion filed by home builder John Treen asks that Duke 's candidacy be declared illegal because he lives outside the suburban New Orleans district that elected him .
Rep. Odon Bacquet objected to letting Republican Duke take his seat , claiming that he did not meet the residency requirement , but Bacquet 's tactic failed when the House voted 69-33 to table his motion .
Duke , who now heads the National Assn .
Outside the Capitol , about 25 students -- both black and white -- chanted `` Do n't seat Duke , keep Duke out . ''
Just before the House met , a state district judge in Metairie , which includes Duke 's district , refused a request by defeated House candidate John Treen for a restraining order to prevent his taking the seat .
Party spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said 28 voting members of the party 's executive committee unanimously repudiated during a telephone vote Duke 's racist and anti-Semitic views and barred financial or other assistance for him .
The resolution adopted by the national Republicans in effect `` excommunicates '' Duke , according to Atwater , who said Duke is neither a Republican nor a Democrat but `` a charlatan and a faker '' using Republicans to promote his racist agenda .
I always figured that David Duke would make something of himself .
That 's because Republican leaders are worried that Duke , who has recently been running something called the National Assn .
In fact , Republican Chairman Lee Atwater was quick to repudiate Duke after his victory , and convinced the party 's executive committee to `` expell '' him by barring Duke from receiving financial or any other kind of assistance .
But while Duke insists on calling himself a Republican , the GOP is stuck with the former klansman .
Despite his loony-sounding affiliations , Duke is not your typical political-fringe dingbat .
I found that out in 1977 , when Duke first got widespread public attention outside of Louisiana .
I was covering Mexican border issues for The Times , and ran across Duke when the 27-year-old racist hit on the idea of a Klan `` border watch . ''
Duke had concluded that illegal immigrants from Mexico had joined blacks , Jews and the other assorted Klan bogymen as threats to white people in the United States .
Despite the fact the Border Patrol said it neither wanted nor needed help from the Klan -- indeed , most agents I knew either laughed at the stunt or were offended by it -- many of my colleagues in the news media swallowed Duke 's self-promotion hook , line and sinker .
That happened on a sadly comic night in late October -- a few days before Halloween , fittingly enough -- when Duke rendezvoused with newsmen in rural San Diego County , just north of the small Mexican town of Tecate .
About 40 newsmen , their TV camera lights setting the dark night ablaze , descended on them to dutifully record Duke 's claims that hundreds of other Klansmen were out that very night , riding their cars along the border and communicating over citizens -band radios , to stem the `` brown tide '' threatening white America .
I spent most of that night monitoring all CB channels and heard nothing except Duke talking to his friends in the two other cars .
It got even worse when I happened to run across Duke in Texas a few days later .
We in the news media did not do ourselves proud in dealing with Duke in 1977 .
The demonstrations that Latinos held against the Klan back then played into Duke 's hands , too , by increasing his notoriety .
But as I ponder his recent success , I think there 's a way that Latinos can use Duke to their advantage this time .
Duke 's victory is the logical extreme of Nixon 's cynical politics .
But maybe with an embarrassment like Duke now sitting on their right flank , Republicans like Atwater will be more inclined to act on their good impulses as well as talk about them .
Duke is somebody else 's problem now , but his reemergence has created an opportunity for minorities in the Republican Party .
They must exploit what Duke symbolizes -- the same way he has eagerly exploited what minorities symbolize to many misguided people .
When one woman called , he said , and told him that `` she had just heard about David Duke being elected to the Louisiana state Legislature and read about Richard M. Daley -LRB- who won the Democratic primary for mayor -RRB- in Chicago saying , 'You want a white mayor , ' and 'now I see a picture of the Ku Klux Klan on campus .
`` I think the racists in this city are people like Jesse Jackson , '' Duke said at a Chicago news conference after addressing the national convention of the right-wing Populist Party of America .
Jackson declined comment on Duke 's statements , except to say : `` I do n't think it 's an American point of view . ''
The middle-aged white woman in the David Duke sweat shirt was pleasantly enthusiastic .
Duke , who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected official , points to such people as proof that his message is becoming acceptable to the mainstream .
for the Advancement of White People , Duke won election to the Louisiana Legislature by talking about the high birth rate among unwed women on welfare and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws .
Duke is not alone in his thinking .
`` The David Duke election was a signal of a sour mood of resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in developing , '' said Irwin Suall , director of fact-finding for the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith .
Some dismiss Duke 's election by just 200 votes as an anomaly ; his suburban New Orleans district is 99 % white .
But Suall and other trackers of racial tension believe that disparate events , such as Duke 's slim victory at the polls and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture , are warning signs to be taken seriously .
At a shopping mall on the edge of Duke 's district , a white woman in her 30s offered her opinion but would not give her name :
`` Or , '' he said , `` these people can vote for a David Duke in the belief they can protect what is mine . ''
Duke , however , believes that he is only the first to tap a growing sentiment .
Duke Sees a Trend
Duke was elected after several unsuccessful attempts .
The differences between then and now , says Duke , are the sophistication of his organization and a change in the mood of the voters .
Sam Altobello , registrar of voters in Jefferson Parish for 18 years , said Duke 's message hit such a responsive chord that people outside his district called to see if they could register there so they could vote for him .
Whether Duke 's rhetoric and its success will carry over in other parts of the country remains to be seen .
Duke says he has been contacted by more than 200 candidates or elected officials interested in his campaign .
Duke , a Republican from Metairie , branded the House action as `` cowardice . ''
Duke vowed to fight to have his measure tacked onto another bill as an amendment .
Duke , however , is unlike his demagogic predecessors .
But his message is the same old line in `` new '' Duke code .
In discounting Duke 's chances , pundits like to cite a Johnston poll that put Duke 's negative rating at 48 % , a number that would scare most politicians into retirement .
Yet Duke 's current standing in the polls is an indication of how far he 's come , despite his negatives , since he won election a year ago to the state legislature by a mere 227 votes in a district that is 99 % white .
One reason is that Duke 's is a campaign in perpetuity .
Last year , a state GOP Central Committee member , Elizabeth Rickey , twice offered a resolution censuring Duke because he was selling Nazi books and had argued that the Holocaust was `` a myth perpetrated on Christians by Jews . ''
But sensing Duke 's blue-collar support , state GOP leaders rejected Rickey 's motions , thereby handing the former Klansman a mantle of legitimacy .
The Faustian pact backfired when two ex- Nazis and a former Klan activist showed up as Duke delegates to the convention that nominated Bagert , who was a Democrat until 1988 .
Now Duke is outpacing his party 's own candidate .
Duke also enjoys some support on Louisiana 's campuses .
Lance Hill , a doctoral student researching the Duke phenomenon at Tulane , which has such a union , believes that most new recruits to the Nazi movement will come from these unions .
Drawing crowds of 800 to 1,000 , Duke routinely calls for -- and gets -- a show of hands of those with a friend or relative afflicted with cancer .
As a state representative , Duke has yet to sponsor a bill that became a law .
Only its main events are reported , with the paper devoting no space to how Duke built his National Assn .
It advocates sterilizing welfare mothers , which Duke translates as `` birth-control incentives '' in his speeches .
To fill the Duke -fact gap , the coalition has become an informational clearinghouse , with Rickey and Hill briefing media across the state .
Still , too many journalists do not question such Duke statements as : `` I was never involved in any illegal activity , and I do n't condone illegal activity . ''
In truth , Duke was convicted , in 1979 , of inciting a riot outside a hotel in the district he now represents .
Duke 's anti- media campaign spares no adversary , no matter how small .
In early May , publisher Harrell Griffin of the St. Helena Echo , a rural weekly , refused to run a Duke advertisement .
According to Griffin , Duke aide Callie S. O'Pry `` called in a very pleasant voice , saying they were going to institute a boycott against the Echo , write letters to all advertisers to stop advertising and do the same with my subscribers .
That week , Duke spoke at a packed hall in Chalmette , a suburb of New Orleans .
When Duke scoffed at the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday , one man piped : `` Kill another one ! ''
Duke appeals to the fears of people who see their living standards declining amid rising crime and drug abuse .
Duke spoke of his `` employment working with the State Department `` in Laos in 1970 .
According to Retired Lt. Col. James May , who was Duke 's senior ROTC instructor : `` His affiliation with Nazism precluded him from getting a commission .
The State Department has no record of Duke 's employment .
But David H. Duke , the candidate 's father , who worked as a civil engineer for the U.S. government in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War , said in an interview last year that his son visited Laos and `` got himself a job '' -- teaching English .
Like Jimmy Swaggart , another folk hero sprung from these latitudes , Duke is a walking psychodrama , challenging reporters to separate fact from the many fictions of his speech .
Yet surely many voted for Duke to send a message , not to embrace the messenger .
Whites cast ballots for Duke ; blacks stayed home , with turnout 15 % less than whites , despite the threat that Duke posed .
Duke made affirmative action the threat -- `` they 're going to take your job . ''
One Duke voter told of a friend who could not get a scholarship to college , while an African-American got one despite a lower grade average .
The vote for Duke is good cause for alarm , but his defeat should not go unnoticed .
Forty years ago , a David Duke might have won the Senate seat , running as a Democrat .
To treat Duke as an exception is a deception .
But what distinguishes Duke from the mainstream Republican Party is his baggage , not his beliefs .
Duke is manipulating the same racial symbols as the Republican Party did under Ronald Reagan and George Bush .
The Klan robes Duke wore in the past are an embarrassment , but his current views fit Republican fashion .
David Duke did better among the young than the old , among males than females .
They have been less quick to forswear their party 's historic antipathy toward civil rights legislation -- an antipathy that made it easier for Duke to call himself a Republican , however uneasy it made GOP regulars feel to hear him say so .
`` The President and the Congress are getting my message , '' Duke said in a hallway interview .
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz -LRB- R - Minn. -RRB- , who voted against the civil rights bill when it was approved by the Senate , switched sides on the override vote. Although his decision came after it was apparent that the measure would fail , Boschwitz said that he changed his position because `` David Duke was sitting in the balcony .
for the Advancement of White People , founded by Duke .
The Louisiana GOP plans to endorse a candidate Jan. 12 , but Duke said that he probably will run even if he is not the party 's choice .
Duke , who in the past has been associated with the far-right Populist Party , disavowed his racist beliefs when he was sworn in as a state representative .
The delegates elected at the caucuses , however , had not been required to support the candidate they said they would vote for .
He said he would oppose Johnston regardless of whether he won the GOP endorsement .
The Republican Party rolled out its biggest guns Thursday -- President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan -- in an effort to keep a former Ku Klux Klan leader from being elected to the Legislature as a member of the GOP .
In 1975 he ran for a state Senate seat , making no attempt to hide his klan affiliation , and won a third of the vote in an affluent Baton Rouge district .
In 1979 , he ran for the 10th District Senate seat in Metairie and won about a fourth of the vote .
In 1988 , he ran for the presidency as a member of the Populist Party .
The seat opened up when Metairie 's representative was elected to a judgeship with about three years left in a four-year term .
Spokesman for Klan
But he had to overcome a Republican opponent endorsed by some GOP heavyweights -- including President Bush and former President Reagan -- to do it .
So he announced that Klan members would begin patrolling the border to help the U.S. Border Patrol catch illegal aliens .
He and seven other men showed up in three old sedans that had hand-painted `` Klan Border Watch `` signs taped on their doors .
We also stirred up anxiety among Chicano activists , and many became agitated at the thought of Latinos being threatened by the Klan .
But what the artwork on a temporary construction fence sparked were complaints that the mural -- which includes images of a nude woman in chains and Ku Klux Klan members -- is sexist and racist , plus counter-complaints of censorship .
Next to them is a group of protesters , symbolizing minority groups who have been victimized by the Klan , said Baca , an assistant art professor .
She said some changes being discussed are enlarging the phrase `` Hello My Name Is Ignorance , '' including a puppeteer who would be pulling the strings of the grand wizard and adding two figures in the Klan scene , a skinhead and a neo- Nazi , she said .
`` He 's for fair play for all , '' she said of the former Ku Klux Klan leader she had come to hear .
Martin Lipset , a Stanford University sociologist , said he believes that other white-rights candidates may be elected to local offices , `` but they 're dead if they have any ambitions to go further . ''
The shrinking middle class sees those in power have nothing left to offer , '' said Tom Metzger , the former Klan leader who heads the separatist White Ayran Resistance , which has courted the skinheads .
A multiracial coalition reelected Bennett Johnston , as such coalitions have elected Democrats from Gov. Douglas Wilder in Virginia and Sen. Wyche Fowler in Georgia .
Unless we plow a new course , we leave fallow fields in which the David Dukes flourish like weeds in the summer .
Former Mayor Dutch Morial , the city 's first black mayor , advertised in 1981 for a firm to remove the monument from the center of a tiny traffic circle .
He was elected last February to the state Legislature .
Since leaving the klan in the 1970s , he has headed the National Assn .

The so-called Big Three -- Marc Girardelli , Pirmin Zurbriggen and Alberto Tomba -- went head-to-head on Vail Mountain Thursday in a giant slalom that was also one of the last stops on Ingemar Stenmark 's farewell tour .
As for the others , Girardelli finished fourth ; Stenmark came in sixth , and Tomba , the 1988 Olympic giant slalom gold medalist , wound up seventh after bouncing up from a near-spill in the first run .
So , Zurbriggen , who was second in Wednesday 's super- G race , Tomba and Stenmark have just one more shot left at a gold medal , in the slalom on Sunday .
What most people here were talking about between runs was Tomba 's spectacular recovery .
`` I was just unlucky , '' Tomba said .
Girardelli , who has already won a gold medal for Luxembourg in the combined , said , `` Tomba should be favored in the slalom , but I am making progress this week and am ready to go , too . ''
After winning a World Cup slalom Thursday at Geilo , Norway , Alberto Tomba told the Associated Press : `` It 's Mother 's Day in Italy today , so I dedicate this victory to my mother and all women in Italy . ''
None of them , however , could head off blond , wiry Rudolf Nierlich , who gave Austria its second gold medal of the World Alpine Ski Championships .
Zurbriggen , who won this event in the 1987 championships on home snow at Crans - Montana , Switzerland , managed to escape with the bronze , just behind Nierlich 's roommate , Helmut Mayer .
Of course , Nierlich will be in that race , too , and his rise to prominence here is not really a surprise , since he has won two World Cup races this season -- a giant slalom at Kirchberg , Austria , and a slalom at Wengen , Switzerland .
but despite a problem near the middle of the course , Nierlich was only 0.45 seconds slower and ended up getting the gold by a 1.62-second margin with a total time of 2 : 37.66 .
Stenmark , the great Swede who will retire just a few days before his 33rd birthday next month during the World Cup Finals at Shigakogen , Japan , after posting a record 85 victories on the circuit , skied two even runs , the sixth fastest each time , for his sixth place .
`` I am skiing for my own pleasure now , '' he said after earning his second medal in 2 days .
Two of the older hands , Felix McGrath and Tiger Shaw , did n't fare as well .
Southland competitors contributed substantially to the U.S. team 's success -- which included 35 gold medals to West Germany 's 16 -- in several divisions :
Greg Evangelatos , 28 , of Sherman Oaks , who is blind , earned a gold medal in the super- G and a bronze in the giant slalom , a performance that also netted him a gold in the combined .
Cathy Gentile , 27 , of Torrance , also an above-the-knee amputee , won the gold medal in the downhill when favored Diana Golden fell , then wound up with the combined gold by placing second in the super- G and the slalom and sixth in the giant slalom -- as Golden won all three .
Evangelatos , who swept the gold medals in his division at last year 's nationals , will not be able to defend his titles , however .
He is proficient in several sports and has only recently added skiing to his activities .
Incidentally , Tiger Shaw of Stowe , Vt. , finished seventh at Geilo , two places ahead of Switzerland 's Pirmin Zurbriggen , who last weekend clinched his fourth World Cup overall title -- equaling the record of Italian Gustavo Thoeni .
Skiing Notes
Bear Mountain , at Big Bear Lake , will stage the Jose Cuervo Games of Winter , a mixture of events , today , then hold the Chevrolet Truck All-American Ski Outing Sunday .

The Social Democratic Party of Germany -LSB- SPD -RSB- is currently the only party that can present a consistent foreign policy concept , which is completely in the tradition of the foreign policies of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt .
-LSB- Rosenbaum -RSB- In view of the new threats from the East -- keyword Zhirinovskiy -- might the voters not finally prefer to leave the present Federal Government in office ?
In the field of European integration , the chancellor 's basic policies are supported by the SPD .
-LSB- Scharping -RSB- I proceed on the assumption that in the Federal Assembly there are , independent of party membership , enough autonomous women and men who will make their decision for Germany 's best benefit .
However , I add the following : From my point of view , the Federal Government can move earlier .
-LSB- Rosenbaum -RSB- If you were chancellor , would you raise these questions anew ?
-LSB- Scharping -RSB- Yes , then I would be able to do so because all these are questions whose organization is controlled by the Federal Government and the chancellor .

THE WORLD 'S two largest nutmeg producers are contemplating the destruction of about 10,000 tonnes of stocks as part of an effort to stiffen the market and improve prices .
The destruction of the stocks , held by Indonesia and Grenada , will be discussed by both countries in a few weeks when the Grenadians will attempt to interest the Indonesians in the recreation of the nutmeg cartel that collapsed two years ago .
Indonesia produces 75 per cent of the world 's nutmeg and Grenada 23 per cent .
In 1986 , before the cartel was established , the world price for nutmeg was about USDollars 1,000 a tonne .
Nutmeg is a significant foreign currency earner for the Caribbean island but represents only a part of a larger spice industry in Indonesia .
Under the agreement creating the cartel , the Indonesian producers undertook to sell their high quality nutmeg at between Dollars 6,800 and Dollars 7,000 a tonne and low quality at between Dollars 1,000 and Dollars 1,200 a tonne .
For their part , the Grenadians committed themselves to minimum prices of Dollars 6,650 a tonne for their best nutmeg and Dollars 5,575 a tonne for poorer quality .
Indonesia 's high quality mace , the red lacy substance that surrounds nutmeg , had a minimum price of Dollars 13,500 a tonne , with low quality not being sold below Dollars 6,000 a tonne .
The two producers ' groups also agreed to control the volume of nutmeg and mace placed on the market in order to maintain price stability .
By 1989 Grenadians were accusing the Indonesians of reneging on the pact by selling nutmeg and mace below the minimum prices .
THE WORLD 'S two leading nutmeg producers , Grenada and Indonesia , are trying to find common ground on which they can control supply and strengthen the world market for the spice .
Neither Grenada nor Indonesia are willing to say specifically how the new arrangement will work , and the extent of any likely cuts in nutmeg supplies .
Before it was established , the world price for nutmeg was about Dollars 1,000 a tonne .
When the cartel became operative the Indonesian producers undertook to sell their high quality nutmeg between Dollars 6,800 and Dollars 7,000 a tonne , while low quality supplies were to be sold between Dollars 1,000 and Dollars 1,200 a tonne .
The Grenadians had committed themselves to a minimum price of Dollars 6,650 a tonne for their best nutmeg , with a minimum price for poorer quality nutmeg was Dollars 5,575 a tonne .
Grenada 's earnings from nutmeg exports fell from Dollars 18.1m in 1989 to Dollars 4.5m last year .
'The purchasers of nutmeg do not usually note that the Grenadian product is of a higher quality , ' the prime minister says .
Nutmeg exporters in the two main producing countries have agreed on a plan to stabilise and then to increase world market prices for the spice , but have steered clear of recreating the cartel that collapsed six years ago .
The agreement follows discussions between the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association and 35 of the leading exporters in Indonesia , according to Grenadian officials .
Indonesia produces about 75 per cent of the world 's nutmeg , with the eastern Caribbean island having a 23 per cent share .
'We must have some type of continuing dialogue with Indonesia because we feel that Grenada can compete successfully on the international market once we do not have Indonesia dumping their nutmeg on the market at very low prices , ' said Mr Cliff Robertson , chairman of the Grenadian association .
Industry officials said that , while not setting prices , the two producer groups would co-operate in monitoring the volume of nutmeg that was offered for sale on the world market .
When the cartel was established the Grenadian association and Aspin , the Indonesian producers ' group , agreed minimum prices for premium and lower grade nutmeg that were about four times higher than the going price of Dollars 1,000 .
Indonesian producers had now agreed with the Grenadians that an increase in the price of nutmeg was needed , said Mr Robertson .
The producers will also attempt to cut commodity brokers out of the industry , and try to market directly to consumers .
'This will allow us to bypass the commodity brokers .

Maverick film maker Robert Altman will go to Italy this fall to shoot his next project , a biography of 19th-Century Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini , whom Altman calls `` the Mick Jagger of his day . ''

Bishop , a Scientologist , had changed the school 's name to the Apple School , hired teachers who were also Scientologists and used educational principles developed by Hubbard and codified in a manual he wrote called the `` Basic Study Manual . ''
In an interview with two Times reporters several years ago , Bishop said she paid the church for the use of Hubbard 's teaching methods , eventually handing over 15 % of the school 's revenues to the Church of Scientology .
She stopped paying the fees but continued to use Hubbard 's techniques .
During his lifetime , Hubbard had written letters to the FBI , the White House and the Veterans Administration , letters that biographer Miller obtained through a Freedom of Information request .
He planned to quote from the letters in an effort to show that Hubbard was a fraud and a liar .
The ruling involving the Hubbard materials went further , and , in appeals to the high court , the Assn .
of American Publishers described the rulings in the Salinger and Hubbard cases as `` a one-two punch landed by the 2nd Circuit on historical and scholarly publishing .
Hubbard , under his `` doctrine of exchange , '' contended that a person must learn to give as well as to receive .
The organization has been in and out of court for years , battling dozens of suits filed by former members who have charged that they were defrauded and harassed by Hubbard 's followers .
L. Ron Hubbard enjoyed being pampered .
The youngsters , whose parents belonged to Hubbard 's Church of Scientology , would lay out his clothes , run his shower and help him dress .
When Hubbard 's bursitis acted up , a messenger would wrap his shoulders in a lumberjack shirt that had been warmed on a heater .
Long gone were those days when Hubbard was scratching out a living .
It was a high honor for Scientologists to serve beside Hubbard , even if it meant performing such dreary tasks as ironing his clothes or ferrying his messages .
The privileged few who worked at his side saw personality flaws and quirks not reflected in the staged photographs or in Hubbard 's biographies .
When upset , Hubbard was known to erupt like a volcano , spewing obscenities and insults .
Former Scientologist Adelle Hartwell once testified during a Florida hearing on Scientology that she saw Hubbard `` throw fits . ''
Hubbard had been hotheaded since his youth , when his red hair earned him the nickname `` Brick . ''
One of Hubbard 's classmates recalled a day in 11th Grade when the husky Hubbard , for no apparent reason , got into a fight with Gus Leger , the lanky assistant principal at Helena High School in Helena , Mont .
Hubbard wrestled with the teacher , then stuffed him into a trash can , said Richardson .
Richardson said that , while the students helped their teacher , Hubbard stormed out and never returned .
In later life , one thing that could throw the irascible Hubbard into a rage was the scent of soap in his clothes .
To protect themselves from a Hubbard tirade , the messengers rinsed his clothes in 13 separate buckets of water .
Doreen Gillham , who had who spent her teen years with Hubbard , never forgot what happened when a longtime aide offered him a freshly laundered shirt after he had taken a shower .
Gillham said that Hubbard had become obsessed not only with soap smells but with dust , which aggravated his allergies .
Gillham , formerly one of Hubbard 's most loyal and trusted messengers , said his behavior became increasingly erratic after he crashed a motorcycle in the Canary Islands in the early 1970s .
According to those who knew him well , Hubbard was neither affectionate nor much of a family man .
Hubbard expected his children to live up to the family name and do nothing that would reflect badly on him or the church .
`` He thought Quentin was an embarrassment , '' said Laurel Sullivan , Hubbard 's former public relations officer , who had a falling out with the organization in 1981 .
When Hubbard was told of the suicide , `` he did n't cry or anything , '' according to a former aide .
Hubbard also had problems with another son , his namesake , L. Ron Hubbard Jr .
Hubbard feuded with his eldest son for more than 25 years , dating back to 1959 when L. Ron Hubbard Jr. split with Scientology because he said he was not making enough money to support his family .
For his part , Hubbard accused his son of being crazy .
Although Hubbard cast himself as a humble servant to mankind , former assistants said he was not without ego .
`` Time and again since 1950 , '' Hubbard said in 1982 , `` the vested interests which pretend to run the world -LRB- for their own appetites and profit -RRB- have mounted full-scale attacks .
Former Scientologist Hartwell told the Florida hearing that she was present when Hubbard made a film about `` bombing the FBI office . ''
`` And we could n't get enough on them to suit Hubbard .
Even before Scientology , Hubbard believed that unseen forces were against him .
`` I watched him operate , '' said `` Dianetics '' publisher Arthur Ceppos , who later split with Hubbard .
This siege mentality led Hubbard to author a series of church policies on how to combat suspected foes -- writings that , more than any of his others , have worked to reinforce Scientology 's cultish image and undermine its quest for legitimacy .
Eventually , 11 top Scientologists were jailed , including Hubbard 's wife Mary Sue , who oversaw the sweeping operation .
Hubbard was named as an unindicted co-conspirator .
Hubbard and three trusted aides , fearing that his enemies had at long last gained the upper hand , ran for cover .
`` When the raids happened he never really knew what they -LRB- the FBI -RRB- had , '' recalled Dede Reisdorf , one of those who accompanied Hubbard .
To disguise Hubbard 's appearance , Reisdorf said , she cut his red hair and dyed it brown .
It was not the last time Hubbard would go into hiding .
In 1980 , on St. Valentine 's Day , Hubbard pulled another disappearing act .
Hubbard was last seen publicly in February 1980 , in the desert community of Hemet , a few miles from a high-security compound that houses the church 's movie and recording studio .
The church said Hubbard went into seclusion to continue his Scientology research and to resurrect his science fiction-writing career .
Publications throughout the world ran stories about Hubbard 's disappearance .
In 1982 , Hubbard 's estranged son filed a probate petition trying to wrest control of the Scientology empire .
The suit was dismissed after Hubbard , through an attorney , submitted an affidavit with his fingerprints , saying that he was well and wanted to be left alone .
No doubt , Hubbard would have chuckled with satisfaction over the speculation surrounding his whereabouts .
Hubbard took with him only two people , a married couple named Pat and Anne Broeker .
Pat Broeker , Hubbard 's personal messenger at the time , had gone into hiding with him once before and knew how to ensure his security .
His nickname among Hubbard 's other messengers was `` 007 . ''
Anne had been one of Hubbard 's top aides for years .
She was cool under pressure and able to defuse Hubbard 's volatile temper .
Hubbard and the Broekers spent their first several years together on the move .
Then , in the summer of 1983 , they decided to settle down in a dusty ranch town called Creston , population 270 , where the hot , arid climate would be kind to Hubbard 's bursitis .
Hubbard and the Broekers concocted an elaborate set of phony names and backgrounds to conceal their identities from the townsfolk .
Hubbard became Lisa 's father , Jack , who impressed the locals as a chatty old man , charismatic but sometimes gruff .
In less than three years , Hubbard poured an estimated $ 3 million into the local economy as he redesigned the ranch to his exacting and elaborate specifications .
The 10 -room ranch house was gutted and remodeled so many times that it went virtually uninhabited during Hubbard 's time there .
All this was done without work permits , which meant that Hubbard and his aides would not have to worry about nosy county inspectors .
Like Hubbard 's aides in earlier years , the hired help saw extreme sides of the man who was chauffeured around the property in a black Subaru pickup by Anne Broeker .
Several days later , Froelicher said , Hubbard presented him with a 35mm camera as a gift .
Scientology officials insist that Hubbard was in fine mental and physical health during his years in seclusion .
But Hubbard was doing much more , according to former aides .
As early as 1966 , Hubbard claimed to have relinquished managerial control of the church .
But ex- Scientologists and several court rulings have held that this was a maneuver to shield Hubbard from potential legal actions and accountability for the group 's activities .
Over the years , efforts to conceal Hubbard 's ties to the church were extensive and extreme .
`` Anything that indicated that L. Ron Hubbard controlled the church or was engaged in management was to be shredded , '' recalled Hubbard 's former public relations officer , Laurel Sullivan .
In his self-imposed exile , Hubbard continued to reign over Scientology with almost paranoid secrecy .
Hubbard 's communiques travelled a circuitous route in the darkness of night , changing hands from Broeker to Miscavige at designated sites throughout Southern California .
To mask the author 's identity , the missives were signed with codes that carried the weight of Hubbard 's signature .
Sometimes Broeker himself appeared from parts unknown to personally deliver Hubbard 's instructions to church executives .
From his secret seat of power in the oak -studded hills above San Luis Obispo , Hubbard also made sure that he would not be severed from the riches of his Scientology empire , high-level church defectors would later tell government investigators .
They alleged that Hubbard skimmed millions of dollars from church coffers while he was in hiding -- carrying on a tradition that the Internal Revenue Service said he began practically at Scientology 's inception about 30 years ago .
Hubbard and his aides had always denied the allegations , and accused the IRS of waging a campaign against the church and its founder .
While Hubbard was underground , the IRS launched a criminal probe of his finances .
By late 1985 , Hubbard 's directives to underlings had tapered off .
On or about Jan. 17 , 1986 , Hubbard suffered a `` cerebral vascular accident , '' commonly known as a stroke .
Caring for him was Gene Denk , a Scientologist doctor and Hubbard 's physician for eight years .
There was little Denk could do for Hubbard in those final days -- the stroke was debilitating .
One week later , at 8 p.m. on Friday , Jan. 24 , Hubbard died .
For more than 11 hours , Hubbard 's body remained in the motor home where he died .
Scientology attorney Earle Cooley had ordered that Hubbard not be touched until he arrived by car from Los Angeles with another Scientology lawyer .
With Cooley present , Hubbard was transported to the mortuary .
Once chapel officials learned who Hubbard was , however , they became concerned about the church 's rush to cremate him .
When then-Deputy Coroner Don Hines arrived , Cooley presented him with a certificate that Hubbard had signed just four days before his death .
Cooley also produced a will that Hubbard had signed the day before he died , directing that his body be promptly cremated and that his vast wealth be distributed according to the provisions of a confidential trust he had established .
With Cooley 's consent , he also photographed the body and lifted fingerprints as a way to later confirm that it was the reclusive Hubbard and not a hoax .
Within hours , Hubbard 's ashes were scattered at sea by the Broekers and Miscavige .
Two days after Hubbard 's death , Pat Broeker stood before a standing-room-only crowd of Scientologists at the Hollywood Palladium .
It was his first public appearance in six years , and he had just broken the news of Hubbard 's passing .
Broeker announced that Hubbard had made a conscious decision to `` sever all ties '' to this world so he could continue his Scientology research in spirit form -- testimony to the power of the man and his teachings .
Hubbard left behind an organization that would continue to function as though he were still alive .
By so doing , the church hopes to broaden the acceptability of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings and attract millions of new members .
Scientologists are disseminating Hubbard 's writings in public and private school classrooms across the U.S. , using groups that seldom publicize their Scientology connections .
In the business world , Scientologists have established highly successful private consulting firms to promote Hubbard as a management expert , with a goal of harvesting new , affluent members .
The organizations have been busy trying to sell government agencies a chemical detoxification treatment developed by Hubbard .
In 1980 , 11 top church leaders -- including Hubbard 's wife -- were imprisoned for bugging and burglarizing government offices as part of a shadowy conspiracy to discredit the church 's perceived enemies .
But as the movement attempts to broaden its reach , evidence is mounting that Hubbard 's devotees are engaging in practices that , while not unlawful , have begun to stir memories of its troubled past .
The Scientology movement has launched a concerted campaign to gain a foothold in the nation 's schools by distributing to children millions of copies of a booklet Hubbard wrote on basic moral values .
The program is designed to win recognition for Hubbard as an educator and moralist and , at the same time , introduce him to the nation 's youth .
The pocket-size booklet , entitled `` The Way to Happiness , '' is a compilation of widely agreed upon values that Hubbard put into writing in 1981 .
The booklet notes in small print that it was written by Hubbard as `` an individual and is not part of any religious doctrine . ''
Her group runs a nationwide contest encouraging students to stay off drugs by following the precepts in Hubbard 's booklet .
In Louisiana , a junior high school distributed Hubbard 's booklet to students and then had them pledge in writing :
At contest awards ceremonies , the winners and Hubbard 's book share the spotlight .
Scientology critics contend that the contest is being used to enlist new church members , who , as the theory goes , may be so inspired by `` The Way to Happiness `` that they will reach for Hubbard 's other writings .
For the most part , school officials whose campuses have participated in the contest said they were unaware of Hubbard 's Scientology connection or that his followers were directing the contest .
But one California public school system recently banned the contest after administrators conducted an investigation and learned that Hubbard was the author of Scientology 's doctrine .
In Spring , 1989 , the students won second place for organizing an anti-drug relay in which they passed each other a symbolic `` torch '' -- Hubbard 's booklet .
Garratt said that , while he was aware of Scientology , he had never heard of Hubbard .
He said he learned of the connection at the local library , where he went to investigate Hubbard 's background .
Garratt said the association refused to consider the possibility of holding the contest without Hubbard 's booklet .
Scientologists also are attempting to install a Hubbard tutorial program in public schools , using a church -affiliated organization called Applied Scholastics .
Applied Scholastics currently has plans to build a 1 , 000-acre campus , where the organization would train educators to teach Hubbard 's tutorial program .
A recent Applied Scholastics mailer predicted that the training center will be a `` model of real education for the world '' and `` create overwhelming public popularity '' for Hubbard .
Developed for students of Scientology , the Hubbard program is built upon an elementary premise : learning difficulties arise when students read past words they do not understand .
`` The misunderstood word in a subject produces a vast panorama of mental effects and is the prime factor involved in stupidity , '' Hubbard wrote in 1967 .
The Compton Unified School District in 1987 and 1988 allowed the Hubbard program to be tested with 80 students at Centennial Senior High School .
In applying for district financing , Clegg said the educational program was `` developed by American writer and educator L. Ron Hubbard . ''
Excluding any reference to Hubbard 's Scientology connection , he persuaded the board to provide $ 5,000 to tutor 30 sophomores with low reading scores and to conduct a parent workshop .
A Scientology publication in 1987 reported that the consultant network earned a combined $ 1.6 million a month selling Hubbard 's management methods to a variety of professionals , many of whom have reported improved incomes .
Businessmen are drawn into Scientology after they have gained confidence in Hubbard 's non-religious management methods .
It trains and licenses the firms to sell Hubbard 's copyrighted `` management and administrative technology . ''
On top of this , the consulting firms that sell Hubbard 's business methods must pay WISE 13 % of their annual gross income .
At the heart of Hubbard 's business system is a concept he called `` management by statistics , '' which he said guarantees optimum office efficiency .
A company spokesman said the firm charges clients $ 10,000 for its complete line of Hubbard courses and 30 hours of private consultation .
Mailed free to 300,000 health care professionals nationwide , it is filled with `` management '' articles by Hubbard that are actually excerpts from Scientology 's governing doctrines .
Hughes holds seminars across the country , offering himself as evidence that Hubbard 's methods work .
But neither the paper 's readers nor those who attend Hughes ' seminars are told that his dental office , which employed the high-volume Hubbard techniques that he imparts to others , has been accused by former patients of dental negligence and malpractice .
Another firm once licensed by Scientology 's WISE organization to sell Hubbard 's management techniques was Singer Consultants .
Singer Consultants was headed by Scientologist David Singer , an accomplished speaker and chiropractor who held nationwide seminars to pitch Hubbard 's business methods .
Although Singer refused to be interviewed by The Times , he told Dynamic Chiropractic : `` Hubbard was a prolific writer and wrote on a multitude of subjects .
Hubbard was so proud of a detoxification treatment he developed -- and so hungry for plaudits -- that he openly talked with his closest aides about winning a Nobel Prize .
They have embarked upon a controversial plan to win recognition for Hubbard and his treatment program in scientific and medical circles .
But some health authorities dismiss Hubbard 's program as a medical fraud that preys upon public fear of toxins .
In that context , it is simply called the `` Hubbard Method . ''
The nonprofit foundation has forged links with scientists across the country to gain legitimacy for itself and , thus , for Hubbard 's detox method .
`` The concept , '' he said , `` was to get some scientific recognition '' for Hubbard 's treatment without overtly linking it to the church .
Buttressing Franks ' account , the foundation 's original incorporation papers state that its purpose was to `` research the efficacy of and promote the use of the works of L. Ron Hubbard in the solving of social problems ; and to scientifically research and provide public information and education concerning the efficacy of other programs . ''
The document was later amended , however , to remove Hubbard 's name , obscuring the foundation 's ties to the Scientology movement and its founder in official records .
Hubbard 's name , however , continues to appear regularly in the foundation 's slick newsletter .
In the latest edition , for instance , three different articles advocate the `` Hubbard method '' as an effective therapy for chemical and drug detoxification .
A fourth article did not mention Hubbard by name , but reported favorably on Narconon , his drug and alcohol rehabilitation program , which is run by Scientologists .
The other organization in the outreach effort is HealthMed Clinic , which administers Hubbard 's treatment from offices in Los Angeles and Sacramento and is run by Scientologists .
An independent medical consultant in Maryland who reviewed the program for the city of Shreveport , La. , dismissed Hubbard 's treatment as `` quackery . ''
The foundation , for its part , tries to scientifically validate the Hubbard method through studies and articles by individuals who either are Scientologists or hold foundation positions .
The four physicians who prompted the investigation said they decided to study the Hubbard treatment after receiving calls from union representatives , public agencies and individual workers throughout the state who had been solicited by the clinics .
The Hubbard method has been pitched to them as a cure for exposure to a carcinogen sometimes encountered during fires .
He said the foundation had found an effective detoxification technique developed by `` the late American researcher L. Ron Hubbard `` and delivered by HealthMed Clinic .
The article did not mention another of Hubbard 's notable developments -- Scientology .
I think L. Ron Hubbard is a bona fide genius . ''
Although city officials had learned of Hubbard 's Scientology connection , they were unconcerned .
A key element of the management techniques Scientologists sell to businessmen is L. Ron Hubbard 's `` organizational board . ''
In describing the Org Board 's virtues , Scientology consultants omit Hubbard 's colorful account of its origins -- an account reminiscent of one of his science fiction tales .
During a 1965 lecture to Scientologists in England , Hubbard said his board is a refined version of one that was used for `` 80 trillion years `` by an `` old galactic civilization . ''
Hubbard said the civilization died -LRB- he did not say when -RRB- because its organizational board lacked one division that he incorporated into his modern-day version .
Declared Hubbard : `` We do n't want these temporary fly-by-night affairs ! ''
L. Ron Hubbard
Consider the passage that a prominent Scientology minister selected from the religion 's scriptures , authored by the late L. Ron Hubbard , to inspire the faithful during a gala church event .
`` People attack Scientology , '' the minister quoted Hubbard as saying .
As far back as 1959 , Hubbard warned that illness and even death can befall those seeking to impede Scientology , known within the church as `` suppressive persons . ''
`` Literally , it kills them , '' Hubbard wrote , `` and if you do n't believe me I can show you the long death list . ''
`` Within a few weeks , '' Hubbard said , `` he contracted TB . ''
Before a British author 's critical biography of Hubbard was even released two years ago in Europe , the church had him and his publisher tied up in a London court for alleged copyright infringement .
`` We do not find critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts , '' Hubbard wrote back in 1967 .
When Scientology takes the offensive , L. Ron Hubbard 's writings provide the inspiration .
Here is a sampling of what Hubbard wrote :
Ironically , Hubbard 's doctrinal dictums have often served only to escalate conflicts and reinforce the cultish image the church has been trying to shake .
He wrote that `` anyone whose attitude is such as Mr. Hubbard displays in his writings can not be too surprised if the world treats him with suspicion rather than affection . ''
Its predecessor was the Guardian Office , whose members became so overzealous that Hubbard 's wife and 10 other Scientologists were jailed for bugging and burglarizing U.S. government agencies in the 1970s .
In 1980 , he investigated the sex life of U.S. District Judge James Richey , who was presiding over the criminal trial of Hubbard 's wife and the 10 other Scientologists .
Scientologists believed Mayo was using stolen Hubbard teachings .
Written by Hubbard in the mid-1960s , it states that anyone who impedes Scientology is `` fair game '' and can `` be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist .
Church spokesmen maintain that Hubbard rescinded the policy three years after it was written because its meaning had been twisted .
What Hubbard actually meant , according to the spokesmen , was that Scientology will not protect ex- members from people in the outside world who try to trick , sue or destroy them .
After his biography of Hubbard was published , an anonymous caller to police implicated him in the unsolved ax -slaying of a South London private eye .
And Hubbard 's followers apparently consider his theology of combat an important component .
The Times and staff writers Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos have done a commendable public service with the series on Hubbard and the Church of Scientology .
Corea is an acknowledged devotee of the self-improvement movement founded by the late L. Ron Hubbard .
But it credits Hubbard with writing the words and music to `` Cry Out , '' a song used as an anthem by the group .
Meri Dolan , a Cry Out volunteer who helped Sherman Oaks School officials organize the event , said the only connection between the environmental group and the Church of Scientology `` is L. Ron Hubbard , who wrote the song , 'Cry Out . '
`` I went to the address they gave me , and it said Author Services Inc. on the building but inside you walk into the L. Ron Hubbard Gallery , '' London said .
Moreover , the program itself , developed not by physicians or scientists , but by the founder of the Church of Scientology , has no recognized value in the established medical and scientific community .

The Development of Shanghai Is a Microcosm
There is an element essential to the success or failure of reform as a whole : Whether or not the openness and development in Shanghai will make major headway .
Deng Xiaoping maintained : `` It is a momentous measure to take hold of Shanghai .
Shanghai is our trump card , and it is a short cut to boost the economy in Shanghai ... .
In the past , Shanghai was a financial center , a place where money was freely convertible .
If China wishes to gain an international position in the financial arena , we must rely on Shanghai in the first place . ''
It can be stated that after two or three years of large-scale development and construction , Shanghai has become a dragon head of reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang valley , and even in the entire country .
Shanghai 's reforms in foreign exchange , the securities market , the futures market , and banking have begun to take shape .
Shanghai has taken a crucial step to revive the old dream of an oriental financial center .
Among them , the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in Pudong , Shanghai , set up earliest of all and entirely closed , was the largest , covering an area of 10 square km .
A number of experts hold that the bonded zones in Shanghai 's Waigaoqiao and Xiamen 's Xiangyu boast many conditions favorable to the construction of free ports , which will serve as excellent channels for converging with the international market once China reenters GATT .
Moreover , economist Ju Chongwei proposed that in a bid to build Shanghai into an international financial and trade center , it is necessary to follow the model of Hong Kong in exporting capital , technology , management , and service , and to construct the Chang Jiang valley and southern area of China into a fifth `` little dragon . ''
He viewed with disfavor the practices of absorbing purely foreign capital so as to make only Pudong prosperous , and of developing purely local industries , as such practices can not turn Shanghai into a modern cosmopolis .
It is certain that the economic development and the establishment of a new structure in Shanghai will become a microcosm of the development trend of reform and opening up in China .
Qiao said Hamburg established its partnership with China 's largest industrial city Shanghai as early as in 1986 .
Shanghai , China 's largest economic center , will further cultivate its financial market and expand banking business this year .
According to Mao Yingliang , president of the Shanghai branch of the People 's Bank of China , the financial sector has developed healthily with a stable banking setup , flourishing market , big increase in savings deposits and basically stable foreign exchange rates over the past year .
Shanghai has become the national center for securities exchanges .
The Shanghai Securities Exchange , China 's largest , has 481 members distributed across the country .
According to statistics , inter-bank loans in Shanghai last year rose by 37 percent over the previous year to 232.95 billion yuan .
In addition , seven foreign-funded banks have opened in this , China 's most populous city during the last year , bringing the total number of foreign-funded banks in Shanghai to 26 .
According to the bank president , Shanghai will continue to welcome the opening of foreign-funded bank branches and encourage the existing banking organizations to expand their business this year .
Toshiba Machine has already opened service offices in Singapore and in Kuala Lumpur and Penang , Malaysia , and has plans for offices in Shanghai and Kaohsiung , Taiwan .
The No. 1 Auto Group will supply 180,000 vehicles , the Dongfeng Group 210,000 , the Heavy Vehicle Group 20,000 , China Automobile Company 80,000 , the Beijing Company 130,000 , the Tianjin Company 110,000 , the Shanghai Company 110,000 , the Jinbei Company 40,000 , and converted defense enterprises 140,000 .

In Shanghai , for example , it will cooperate with its mainland partner in running a bonded warehouse at Waigaoqiao .
In the Changjiang River region , Shanghai alone had approved 482 direct Taiwan investment projects between January and September with a negotiated cost of $ 430 million dollars .
Taiwanese businesses investing in the similar industries have joined together and established their own industrial regions , processing zones , and other cluster-oriented areas on the mainland , such as a bicycle production region in Kunshan , Jiangsu Province , a `` computer street `` in Shanghai , and a Taiwan machinery-specialization zone in Xiaoshan , Zhejiang Province .
Commenting on MOTIE 's plan , the 18 February TONGA ILBO reports the government will enact measures to reduce the concentration of South Korean investment in Manchuria and redirect investment toward Shanghai and further south .

In recent years , foreign-funded banks have been allowed to set up offices in Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other open cities along the coast .
To meet the needs of the increasing number of foreign-funded financial organizations , the State Council promulgated the `` Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded Banks and Sino-Foreign- Funded Banks in the SEZ 's '' on 2 April 1985 , and the People 's Bank of China promulgated the `` Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded and Sino-Foreign-Funded Financial Organizations in Shanghai `` on 8 September 1990 .
Citicorp recently transferred its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai and became the first foreign-funded bank to set up a headquarters in China .
J. P. Morgan , Swiss Bank Corporation , and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez of France have gone to Shanghai one after another to discuss setting up branches there .
Guangdong Province same first , followed by Jiangsu Province , Shandong Province , Fujian Province , Zhejiang Province , Shanghai Municipality , Hainan Province , Liaoning Province , Beijing Municipality , and Tianjin Municipality .
In 1993 , when the Shanghai securities market developed at its fastest pace , the number of stock listing leaped by 2.2 times , and the total shares on the market surged some 4.5 times , and when it came to companies listed on the market , they went from only two earlier in the year and expanded to 36 , and there was 2.8 fold increase in the number of member securities traders , while in particular , the market 's annual transaction total reached a volume of 500 billion yuan , making up half of the total volume of Shanghai market transactions .
Shanghai 's planned development target for this century is to again ascend to the position of being one of the country 's , and even the Far Eastern region 's , economic , financial , and trade centers .
Shanghai 's securities transaction market has in a period of just over three years , been the first to take the lead in tracing out a market domain that extends to the entire country .
The Shanghai Stock Market has already broken through regional barriers , and extended over national borders , converging into the systemic circulation of the international capital market .
More than three years ago , on December 19 , 1990 , in the Shanghai city government 's tall gray building , the Shanghai Stock Exchange opened for business .
Today , looking at the Shanghai Stock Exchange , at this location there are 6 transaction halls in use , with 2600 seats , and the number of stocks on the market has increased to 119 , while there are now 481 members .
In the space of three years , the Shanghai stock market overall volume of business has exploded from 280 million yuan to reach 20.1 billion yuan , and the market price total value has also gone from 1.3 billion yuan to 250 billion yuan .
The volume of trade on the Shanghai Stock Market , from the early day totals of 20 million yuan has grown to the present greatest volume of business close to 4 billion yuan .
This means that the `` three year old child `` Shanghai Stock Exchange is comparable to the `` one hundred year-old man `` Hong Kong Stock Exchange , and it 's `` appetite '' is only different by a year 's level .
At present , more than 90 percent of the members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange are securities traders from various locales throughout the country ; more than 70 percent of the investors are from provinces and cities outside Shanghai , spread over cities and towns and even reaching the border regions ; in the Shanghai securities market , there are already more than 1100 securities business sites .
The Shanghai Stock Exchange at present has already established links with the Fuzhou Securities Trading Center and succeeded in operating for 3 months , and also plans to complete major links with 10 securities trading centers including those in Guangzhou , Haikou , Chengdu , and Shenyang .
There are some foreigners in the business who predict that between 2010 and 2020 , the Shanghai Stock Market will become one of the largest stock markets in the world .
Since the emergence of Holland 's Amsterdam Stock Market in 1613 , in stock trading activity there have been 380 years of development in world economic history , and in the three year period since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , through the use of modern high technology methods , the operational methods and market efficiency of the Shanghai securities market stand in the front ranks of current world stock markets .
At the moment , the Shanghai Stock Exchange possesses an electronic computer system that handles 1800 transactions per second , and securities transactions are comprehensively implemented by computer automatic competitive price transactions , while a special purpose space satellite and earth laser fiber optic data transmission stereo communications network has been established ; there has been a comprehensive implementation of a no-paper system for securities transactions , and an automatic ownership transfer system has been implemented , along with same day accounts settling , and a central registration accounts closing system comparable to international standards has been formed .
Taking the emergence two years ago of new China 's first RMB special stocks on the Shanghai securities market as an indication , the Chinese mainland 's securities markets in reality are already moving towards international capital markets , and last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange 's B shares listings went from 9 to 22 , while the market overall volume increased from 800 million yuan to more than 1.8 billion yuan ; in addition , at present 50 overseas securities trading house representatives have seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange , and this means for foreign circles that the door to China 's securities market is wide open .
Last year , the mainland directly entered overseas capital markets with six large enterprises including Qingdao Beer , Shanghai Petrochemical , Guangdong Boat International , Magang Shares , and Kunming Machine Tools , and at the same time on the Hong Kong market H shares , their A shares also started to trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange .
As China 's first capital market launched during reforn and opening , the Shanghai securities market is already having an ever greater deepening effect on China 's economic activity .
Last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange ignited the `` Baoyan Disturbance , '' following on the heels of this was the `` Wanshen Incident , '' which was a precedent for new Chinese enterprises to use market methods for transferring property rights .
Shanghai Stock Exchange General Manager Wei Wenyuan -LSB- 1414 2429 3220 -RSB- , describes prospects for the development of the stock market in Shanghai over the next two or three years as follows : acceleration of the process of market internationalization , and the attraction of international capital ; the promotion of the opening of the government bond market to the outside ; the struggle to have large , well-known foreign corporations list stock on the Shanghai market .
In Shanghai 's most glamorous Pudong New Zone , the `` Shanghai Securities Tower `` has invested US $ 120 million and is each day `` adding brick , adding tile . ''
Judging from the development of the international situation , China will face a rare , favorable opportunity for reform and development over a considerably long period of time .
As asserted by some authoritative observers , China will continue to be in a process of rapid growth .
By and large , various countries in the world look favorably on the economic trend in China , so that the country will continue to be the world 's largest market attracting foreign capital , both at present and for a considerable time to come .
Three Major Signs of Economic Direction : Referring to opportunities , Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out : The new year will be a momentous one in which China 's economy will continue to maintain good development momentum .
The senior CPC leaders hold that reform and opening up over the past two years have been focused on Deng Xiaoping 's remarks during his south China tour , the establishment of the socialist market economy structure defined at the 14th CPC National Congress , and the decision on the `` 50 measures '' adopted at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee , all of which have organically formed the `` three major signposts of China 's economic direction '' in this century , thus effecting a historic transition from a planned economy structure to a market economy structure .
As reform will make a giant stride in the new year in which the number of reform measures to be introduced will be the greatest for the last 15 years , and will involve various areas -- including the state , enterprises , and individuals , as well as various trades and professions -- it will make up an organic body incorporating various major links of reform .
Explorations Should Be Made To Avoid Great Ups and Downs
Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up , China 's economy has experienced several ups and downs , which have aroused attention in various quarters .
The Development Research Center of the State Council , a major think tank in China , has listed it as one of the five major subjects for economic research in the 1990 's .
It is hoped that the exploration into this law will help China avoid great ups and downs in its economy .
When their income sags , they leave their villages and give up farming in order to engage in trade , a process that has led to the ever-increasing number of transients in the cities .
In a considerable number of enterprises , labor protection was poor , with the air seriously polluted with poisonous gas and dust in excess of standards .
The Four Factors Determining the Success or Failure of Reform
Recently , quite a few institutions of information on scientific research , as well as specialists , and academics , made assessments and analyses of China 's situation of reform and openness , as well as its economic trends .
Their relatively unanimous views are that China will continue to maintain a double-digit economic growth rate in the future on the grounds that -- given the somewhat intensified macroeconomic regulation and control -- development in the energy , communications , and essential raw and semifinished materials industries has been accelerated , the growth of real estate and tertiary industry has picked up again .
Some of the serious problems at present are poor public order -- with the number of serious cases remaining high -- and the ugly phenomena still existing in society .
The most important measures for the forward position of reform have been experimented here , and the development of Pudong has made headway , with a substantial influx of various types of foreign funds .
If financial work -- like a pawn in a chess game -- is well played and invigorated , the whole game will be invigorated . ''
Since the beginning of the 1990 's , a total of 12 bonded zones have been set up in China 's coastal areas .
The visiting chairman of China 's National People 's Congress Standing Committee Qiao Shi said here today that China would further its ties with local states , cities and enterprises as well as the German Federal Government .
He added that the number of Chinese companies in Hamburg has risen from one in 1979 to more than 100 today , pointing out that the first Chinese general consulate to Germany is also located there .
He said Germans from all walks of life are welcome to China to work in cooperation with their Chinese counterparts .
Mao noted that professional banks in the city granted loans in a timely fashion to support major state enterprises and construction of key state capital projects , and ensure the state purchase of farm and sideline products in 1993 .
Its foreign exchange swap market clinched deals amounting to 5.294 billion yuan last year , an increase of 43.2 percent over the previous year and ranking first in the country .

Law Has Survived Because No Foreign Pressure Exerted - In an article in the 6 March NIKKEI , Keio University Professor Atsushi Kusano observes that the Large Retail Store Law has survived `` because of the lack of foreign pressure . ''
He notes that without foreign pressure , Japanese discount stores will continue to follow MITI , which wants to avoid any `` disturbance '' or change in the industry .
The article notes that the supermarket chains are also experiencing difficulties because of the recession and the increasing number of discount stores .
Japan 's largest rice trading firm has criticized this policy as promoting the sale of black market rice .
Also , press editorials have criticized the agency 's policy of continued control of rice distribution and selling imported foreign rice at `` considerably higher '' prices to generate profits sufficient to compensate farmers who had poor rice crops last summer .
In an apparent public relations effort , the Imperial Household Agency announced that the imperial family will also eat blended rice -LRB- 70 percent foreign and 30 percent domestic rice -RRB- , the 9 March ASAHI reports .
Food Agency 's Policy Raises Price of Black Market Rice - Seizo Yamazaki , chairman of Yamatane Corp. , Japan 's largest rice trading firm , comments in the 9 March YOMIURI SHIMBUN that `` forcing consumers to buy blended rice is a policy to promote the sale of black market rice `` -LRB- also called `` free market rice , '' the sale of which is illegal -RRB- .
Consumers , Cooperatives Attempt To Secure Rice - As one indication of how far Japanese consumers will go to secure palatable rice , NHK Television in its 9 : 00 pm evening news program on 15 March shows Japanese tourists bringing South Korean rice , which is similar to Japanese rice , into the country aboard ferry boats running from Pusan to Shimonoseki , the closest Japanese port city to South Korea .
The announcer states that some tourists are bringing in as much as 50 kilograms of rice per person ; Japanese citizens are permitted to bring in a total of 100 kilograms of foreign rice per year .
-LRB- Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN 8 Mar 94 p 11 -RRB- Financial Issues - Chinese Provinces Urge Japanese Banks To Set Up Branches -- Provincial and municipal governments in China 's interior areas have requested that Japan 's major commercial banks , such as Sanwa and Sumitomo , establish branches and representative offices in their jurisdictions , according to the 10 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN .
In the past , Japanese banks have focused on China 's coastal areas , where Japanese companies have made conspicuous inroads , but now they are responding to requests made by city and provincial governments in inland areas and are seriously looking into setting up offices there .
The major commercial banks have been `` ardently '' approached by the governments of Liaoning Province , Shenyang City , Jiangsu Province , Nanjing Municipality , Hubei Province , Wuhan City , Shaanxi Province , Xian City , Sichuan Province , and Chongging City , and others .
In their pursuit of economic growth , the local governments have been competing to attract foreign investment .
Their overtures to Japanese banks are thought to be part of their attempt to garner cooperation in capital financing from foreign financial institutions , not just from foreign investors in manufacturing and production .
Despite the fact that investment by Japanese companies in these regions is still rather limited , the banks are now seriously considering where to set up offices in China 's interior areas .
The Chinese Government is moving toward allowing a few foreign banks to open branches in Beijing , but because only one or two will be Japanese banks , the competition is intense .
Sumitomo Bank is Offering seminars to financial institutions in Beijing to enhance its presence there , while the presidents of the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank recently visited China and appealed to the mayor of Beijing for authorization to establish branches .
China To Authorize Japanese Banks To Use Yuan - Japanese banks will be authorized to use the Chinese yuan , but initially only for deposit-taking functions , according to the 8 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN .
The People 's Bank of China has not specified how deposits will be obtained or precisely when the deposit-taking functions will begin , but major Japanese commercial banks understand from discussions with the People 's Bank that they will be able to start taking yuan -based deposits sometime in the spring or summer of 1994 .
The Ministry of Finance has continued to press the Chinese Government to authorize Japanese banks to use the Chinese currency because the recent change in China 's foreign exchange system is having an adverse effect on Japanese banks doing business there , according the 4 February NIKKEI KINYU .
Under the revision , foreign banks can only make loans and conduct foreign exchange transactions in dollars or yen , while foreign companies operating there can only use yuan .
When a Japanese company operating in China sells yuan and buys a foreign currency , it must first transfer the money to the People 's Bank of China , where the Japanese bank has an account , thereby making it more troublesome for the company to use a Japanese rather than a Chinese bank .
According to the 8 March NIKKEI KINYU , some people assert that authorization to use the yuan is a `` matter of life or death '' for Japanese banks in China , and the recent indication that the yuan can be used for deposit-taking functions is being interpreted by Japanese banks as the `` first step '' toward full banking operations .

A recent article in a Seoul journal features the views of two experts on North Korea on the DPRK 's interest in China 's reforms and the prospect for change in North Korea .
In the 3 February SISA JOURNAL , Kim Pong-tok , a professor at Northeast Finance University in China , gave the following reasons as to why North Korea would be interested in China 's approach to reform : a -RRB- China has made economic reform a priority , allowing social changes when timing and conditions are right , in order to `` minimize shock ; '' b -RRB- China has been able to maintain a `` socialist structure '' under `` communist leadership ; '' and c -RRB- if reforms are well planned from the outset , they can take place gradually , as they are in China .
Kim points out that North Korea 's joint venture law offers foreigners more favorable terms than China 's law , and concludes by saying that `` North Korea could rise as a new star of the Far East , if reform is properly handled . ''
SISA also reports the views of Ho Mun-yong , a prominent researcher at the National Unification Research Institute , regarding North Korea 's outlook on China 's reforms .
Ho believes that Kim Il - song 's visit to China in 1982 , Kim Chong-il 's tour of the Shenzhen special economic zone in 1983 , and the enactment of the joint venture law in 1984 are indications that the DPRK is moving toward Chinese-style reforms .
-LRB- Pyongyang NODONG SINMUN 20 Jan 94 p 1 -RRB- SOUTH KOREA : FEATURE : Trade Ministry Announces New China Policy - SUMMARY : South Korea 's Trade Ministry has issued a paper outlining the country 's new plans for economic relations with China , according to ROK press reports .
Seoul is backing its drive into China -with a full range of direct and indirect subsidies designed to give ROK firms an advantage over competitors .
On 17 February , South Korea 's Ministry of Trade , Industry , and Energy -LRB- MOTIE -RRB- released a report entitled `` Comprehensive Measures for Making Inroads into China , '' outlining the ROK 's latest plans for economic relations with the PRC .
Unlike previous ROK economic ventures into China which were `` one-sided and impromptu , '' the current plan takes into account the experiences of Japan , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and other competitors in their dealings with China to help South Korea meet its challenges more effectively , the newspaper says .
Among the plan 's concrete aspects , MKS reports the ROK Government will `` greatly enlarge '' its `` Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund `` and the Export-Import Bank 's `` Deferred Payment Export Fund `` to `` expand the scale on which our companies will be able to provide important plants and facilities which China needs to move forward with its plans for economic development . ''
The paper reports that the former fund is supporting China investors this year with some $ 50 million , and that the figure will grow to $ 5 billion by 1996 .
At present , there are nine China -related deferred payment applications with a total value of $ 1.2 billion , according to the report .
MOTIE intends to `` accelerate '' this by making China `` the main target for deferred payment export financing . ''
MOTIE considers it `` urgent '' that South Korea build its own distribution network in China and is working on a plan to accomplish this , according to MKS .
The ministry aims to put a stop to `` South Korean companies ' indiscriminate investment in China , which has been lopsided by region , '' and will select `` business sectors in which China investment will be encouraged , '' by dropping , for example , the requirement for prior approval .
`` Other types of financial support '' will also be given , such as raising the ceiling on `` Overseas Investment Fund `` loans from 70 percent for large firms and 80 percent for small and medium businesses , to 90 percent for both .
In the automotive sector , TONGA ILBO reports MOTIE wants to export finished cars to China , in addition to producing them locally .
The 19 February MKS reports on how South Korean conglomerates are gearing up for large investments in China in anticipation of government support for increased involvement .
China 's involvement on some level is being considered to facilitate overseas sales .
According to a plan made public on 7 February by the ROK 's Ministry of Trade , Industry , and Energy -LRB- MOTIE -RRB- reported by MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN -LRB- MKS -RRB- the following day , South Korea 's government will sponsor development of a mid-size 50-100 passenger aircraft through a domestic consortium under one leading company , with technical help from a foreign manufacturer , probably European .
Several of the firms cited above have already signed cooperative agreements with Asian countries and are `` extremely dissatisfied '' with the government 's decision to limit foreign cooperation to a single firm .
MOTIE 's quest for a foreign partner stems from its `` concerns ' that local technology is inadequate , and that the ROK would have trouble selling the plane overseas on its own .
CHOSON ILBO notes similarly that MOTIE 's present plan is to invite only one foreign firm to participate in the plane 's development , but that it may bring in a third country , `` including possibly China , '' to facilitate marketing the aircraft .

The moves are also expected to be a `` direct blow '' to ROK exports into China .
China has devalued the yuan by 33.3 percent , fixed the VAT -LRB- which had varied between 8 and 15 percent depending on the type of good -RRB- at 17 percent , and set up a new consumption tax to restrain imports .
While China 's reform measures bring its trade system in line with international standards , they also seem to reveal China 's intention to curb imports .
The exchange rate adjustment and tax measures will act like a `` double trap '' to ROK exports to China .
ROK firms that manufacture in China and export to third countries will see their competitiveness rise .
Also , because foreign currency restrictions are being eased , there is a growing possibility that Chinese firms may expand their imports .

The `` Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded Financial Organizations `` promulgated by Beijing in early March will come into force on 1 April .
As a result , the regulations have attracted attention in banking circles in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Europe , and the United States , which are ready to apply to open branches in mainland China .
More than 10 years ago , foreign-funded financial organizations were allowed to set up representative offices or branches in the four special economic zones -LSB- SEZ -RSB- of Shenzhen , Zhuhai , Shantou , and Xiamen .
However , the two regulations were local documents and the provisions were too strict , which evoked complaints from many foreign investors .
Compared with these two regulations , the unified national regulations for foreign-funded financial organizations , which will come into force on 1 April , are rather flexible .
Figures from Hong Kong 's financial circles say that the new regulations have increased the proportion of fixed assets of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations from 25 percent of net capital plus reserves to 40 percent .
This move encourages foreign-funded financial organizations to increase investment and buy premises .
Although the new regulations do not include renminbi businesses in the scope of foreign-funded financial organizations , some people say they are allowed to deal with `` approved businesses in the country 's currency and other foreign currencies . ''
This shows that there is a possibility of Chinese financial authorities lifting restrictions on foreign-funded financial organizations dealing with renminbi business in a limited way .
A financial expert pointed out : The new regulations turn convertible currency equivalent to the dollar into convertible currency equivalent to the renminbi , which has enhanced the status of the renminbi and has also paved the way for the renminbi to officially become an internationally circulated currency .
According to the new regulations , provisions for the business scope of foreign-funded banks and foreign-funded financial organizations , include the following : Foreign exchange savings and lending , foreign exchange acceptance , approved foreign exchange investment , foreign exchange guarantees , foreign exchange transactions , investigations and consultations , and approved renminbi businesses and foreign currency trading .
As foreign-funded banks have increasingly asked for permission to do renminbi business , Zhao Haikuan , director of the Finance Research Office of the People 's Bank of China , said that foreign-funded banks will be allowed to deal with renminbi business sooner or later , but the problem is that the conditions are not ripe at present .
With the further deepening of China 's economic structural reform and opening up , an increasing number of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations will set up branches and representative offices in China .
More than 50 banks from countries and regions including Japan , the United States , France , Germany , and Hong Kong have also held talks respectively with the People 's Bank of China Beijing branch on the possibility of establishing a joint bank .
Taiwan financial consortia which intend to set up branches on the mainland include Juntai , Tungtisi , Tungyee , Leeba , and Yuantung .
With the rapid development of China 's economy and the implementation of the new regulations , it is estimated that more and more foreign-funded financial organizations will set up branches or offices on the mainland .
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has recently listed ten main provinces and cities which accommodated the greatest number of three type foreign funded enterprises while at the same time the ten main foreign countries and regions which made the largest investment in China were also selected , according to a national meeting on the registration and administration of foreign funded enterprises .
There were 167,500 three type foreign funded enterprises as of late last year since the implementation of reform and the opening to the outside world 14 years ago .
Of them the Sino-foreign joint ventured enterprises made up 107,800 , Sino-foreign cooperative ventured enterprises 25,500 and solely foreign funded enterprises 34,000 .
The ten main provinces and cities seeing the largest number of foreign funded enterprises were ranked in descending order as follows .
Countries and regions where three type foreign funded enterprises came from and made investment in China rose to 146 as of late 1993 .
The ten main countries and regions which saw the greatest number of such enterprises run in China were put in a descending order .
This was the new China 's first Stock Exchange , and from this emerged China 's first new and developing capital market .
At the same time , the number of securities investors has expanded from 30 thousand to over 4.6 million people .
What this series of numbers represents is the fact that there is no doubt that Shangai has already started down the road to becoming the radiation center for China 's securities market .
It indicated that China 's securities market , in the same way as the international securities market , is striding towards the function of becoming a multifaceted capital market .
Stock markets not only serve as vehicles for enterprises to raise funds , but also provides a concrete method for thousands and thousands of investors to directly participate in financial investment , and participate in share enterprise management ; they also serve as a mechanism for enteprises to transform management , and better allocate property rights and resources .
When it comes to development of the bond market , taking government bonds as primary , we need to create new types of trading products , and not only have a futures buy back business , but also there is a need for having option dealing , to supply services for reform of the financial system , and coordinate central bank regulation of the currency supply .

Jury selection was to begin today in the case of Robert T. Morris Jr. , 24 , of Arnold , Md. , the first person to be tried criminally under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
Robert Tappan Morris was indicted by a federal grand jury in Syracuse , N.Y. , on one count of accessing without authorization at least six computers in which the federal government has an interest .
Morris , who has been criticized by a Cornell University commission that investigated last November 's computer virus incident , is the first person to be charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 , the Justice Department said .
Morris , who is on leave from Cornell , could face a possible five-year sentence and a $ 250,000 fine if convicted .
Morris has told friends that he created the virus but did not intend for it to invade computers around the country .
Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni claimed federal prosecutors broke an agreement with defendant Robert Tappan Morris Jr. , 24 , of Arnold , Md. , by telling reporters that the government might allow Morris to plead guilty to a misdemeanor , instead of facing trial on a felony charge , and he argued that the `` blanket indictment '' was not specific enough in its charges .
Morris pleaded not guilty on Aug. 2 .
A federal magistrate Friday refused to dismiss a felony charge against a former Cornell University computer whiz accused of planting a `` worm `` program that shut down about 6,000 computers nationwide .

In October 1992 , Morocco -- France 's largest supplier of hashish and the world 's largest exporter of the drug -- launched a campaign to suppress trafficking in this traditional local cash crop .
As successor to the Kif and Tobacco Authority established by the French colonial regime in 1926 , Morocco 's Agriculture Ministry each year reports the acreage devoted to each crop .
In 1993 , `` cannabis covers at least 65,000 ha in northern Morocco , '' says the OGD , which was given access to data acquired by the ministry 's Economic Statistics Service .
The conclusion : Not only do `` increasing well-organized Moroccan rings engage in international marketing of derivatives of cannabis produced in Morocco , '' but `` this increase in trafficking would not have been possible without pervasive corruption at all levels of the bureaucracy . ''
The interior minister has told his European interlocutors that if present trends persist -- with Italy and Germany apparently inclined to follow Netherlands ' lead and decriminalize hashish -- it would be a mistake for Morocco to eradicate crops that may sometime be legal in Europe .
Cannabis Cultivation Grows Despite Efforts of Moroccan Government
The first half of 1993 also saw a significant increase in highway checkpoints in the northern part of the country .
TO DRUG enforcement officers they are known as 'swallowers ' or 'mules ' and in recent years Nigerians , who ingest condoms and balloons filled with heroin and cocaine , have emerged as the world 's leading drug traffickers .
The multi-million dollar illicit trade in drugs is tightly controlled by Nigerians who use Lagos as a transit station and exploit the country 's loose banking system , porous borders and a police and customs force notorious for corruption .
Nigerian drug barons have also flourished in a country where it is easy to launder drug money through the free-wheeling banking sector and where the recently established National Drug Law Enforcement Agency is inadequately funded .

The plan to link the US refuge in north-east Alaska and Canadian parkland in Yukon territory is part of an Interior Department options paper drawn up at the beginning of August .
Oil companies still hope to gain access to the fields in the longer term and oppose any move that would obstruct the future development of arctic reserves .
'It is one of the unfortunate accidents of fate , ' says Scott Kearin of the Alaska Wilderness League , 'that an area the oil industry thinks is very promising ca n't be developed without destroying the caribou herd .
Twinning the refuge and the Canadian national parks is a proposal most environmentalists would like to see adopted , even though it does not meet their ultimate target of getting wilderness designation -LRB- which prohibits any future industrial development -RRB- for the ANWR coastal plain .

It is the Human Genome Project , and it concerns nothing less than the nature of man .
Genome research is the province of that department of biological science called genetics .
The quantity of information in a single human genome is equivalent to the amount of data in a thousand telephone directories each a thousand pages long .
But these advances are based on limited and partial knowledge of the human genome , which until recently presented too large a task for more than piecemeal investigation .
Thanks to brilliant recent discoveries about how to read the genetic code , together with the bold imagination and resolve of scientists prepared to work together on a long-term international project , the limits on scientific understanding of the genome are being pushed back .
At a meeting in San Diego , California , in October 1989 , the Human Genome Project was launched , scheduled to take 15 years and promised Dollars 3bn by the US government over that period .
James Watson , one of the discoverers of DNA and the Genome Project 's head , has said : 'A more important set of instruction books will never be found by human beings .
Shapiro takes us through the detective story of how genetics developed , and lucidly explains the nature of the genome and the task of investigating it .
Both books make admirable and successful efforts to equip general readers with a clear grasp of the issues - an important matter , because the future of genome research prompts a number of difficult questions .
This is illustrated by both books when they turn from explanation of the genome project to the consequences of its successful completion .
Geneticists are close to being able to 'read ' the entire genome , and when they can they will not only know which ancestors gave us our coloration , height and other characteristics , but they will be able to tell us something of our fate also -LRB- for example , what diseases we are prone to suffer -RRB- .
This surprising discovery , by Mike Gale , Graham Moore and colleagues at Britain 's John Innes Centre in Norwich , working with the Japanese Rice Genome Research Programme , has huge implications for cereal breeding .
Rice will become the main focus of genetic research in cereals , because its genome is so much smaller and therefore easier to manipulate than the other species .
The government-funded Rice Genome Research Programme , is now half way through the task of discovering the precise chemical sequence of the estimated 30,000 rice genes .
The sum of all genetic material in a given organism is called the 'genome ' .
When scientists can read the code , they will have information about an individual 's genetic make-up which will reveal not only his heredity -LRB- for example , which forebears bequeathed him his height , colouring and other traits -RRB- , but something of his fate also - for example , the diseases he has or might be prone to , and the possibility of his offspring inheriting these or those characteristics and conditions .
When finally interpreted , the genetic messages encoded within our DNA will provide the ultimate answers to the chemical underpinnings of human existence . '
Armed with so much genetic knowledge , will we be tempted to manipulate the genetic material of future people not just to exclude hereditary diseases , but to make them taller , more intelligent , more athletic ?
Should employers know the genetic profile of potential employees , some of whom they might refuse to employ because they have , say , a genetic risk of early death from heart disease ?
National restrictions on outside road hauliers mean that up to a fifth of Community lorries are driving around empty at any given time .
The interesting thing is that the genetic diversity discernible in such a soup would be very small : all humans are closely related because their evolution is such a recent event .
Seen through the lens of genetic science , humankind 's nature and history appear fascinating , extraordinary , and sometimes terrifying .
The collection of all such packets in an individual is called his 'genome ' ; the data it contains is equivalent in amount to a billion -page telephone directory .
After explaining the nature and functioning of genes , and how our genetic past lingers in our present , he takes us through an unfolding series of topics , a chapter on each .
They include human evolutionary history ; the development of language , agriculture and urbanisation ; the effects of disease ; the question of race ; the promise and danger of genetic engineering ; and the genetic prospects for humanity 's future .
It is one of the most potent agents for genetic change .
But it is humanity 's newly-acquired control over its genetic destiny which makes us mistrust the future .
Scientists dislike prognostication , but Jones bravely asks : how will our genetic destiny be affected by our increased knowledge , our younger reproductive ages , our dramatically increased 'outbreeding ' or population mixing , our ageing populations , our pollution problems , and much besides ?
Today , the different cereals vary enormously in their overall genetic characteristics .
At one extreme is wheat , with a vast amount of genetic material - six times more DNA than a human being - divided between 21 giant chromosomes .
It means that breeders , who have traditionally studied each species separately , can pool information and quickly come up with a common genetic map that applies to all grasses and cereals .
Once genes for important characteristics - for example those conferring resistance to heat or cold , disease or drought - are identified in one cereal , they can be inserted into another , using the rapidly developing technology of genetic engineering .
At the same time , plant scientists worldwide are making rapid progress in developing the genetic engineering technology that will be required to make practical use of the newly discovered genes .
In the longer run , there is potentially huge scope for genetic engineering of all cereals to make them more resistant to attack by pests and diseases and to withstand adverse weather .
But as Paul Lazzeri of the IACR 's Rothamsted Experimental Station points out : 'In parallel with the research , we have to resolve the question of the public acceptance of genetic engineering of food . ' Scientists believe that the world will have to accept genetically engineered cereals .

THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew , unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana , may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of President George Bush .
US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana , the American Insurance Services Group said yesterday , Nikki Tait reports .
However , the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still .
Hurricane Hugo , which hit the east coast in September 1989 , cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn .
With Florida 's Hurricane Andrew losses added in , the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn .
This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989 , when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California .
A LEADING US insurance company yesterday estimated that the industry could face losses of around Dollars 8bn to Dollars 10bn as a result of Hurricane Andrew , which left a five-day trail of destruction in Florida and Louisiana .
HURRICANE Andrew , claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history , yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana , inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans .
Hurricane Hugo , which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989 , cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn .
THE US insurance industry expects to pay out Dollars 10.2bn in claims to victims of Hurricane Andrew , which ripped through southern Florida and Louisiana in late August .
One reason for believing the insurance cycle should turn following the Hurricane Andrew losses is that property-casualty insurers are believed to be carrying lower levels of catastrophe reinsurance than they were a few years ago .
STANDARD & Poor 's , one of the large Wall Street rating agencies , yesterday announced that it was reviewing the debt ratings of Allstate Insurance Company , with a view to possible downgrade , as a result of the insurer 's revised assessment of the losses from Hurricane Andrew earlier this year .
Two losses in particular - a typhoon in Japan in 1991 and Hurricane Andrew in the US last year - have given impetus to the upswing , strengthening the hand of underwriters and allowing them to force through price increases .
The annual results were boosted by significantly lower catastrophe losses last year than in 1992 when the insurance industry paid out large sums following Hurricane Andrew and other big disasters .
Discussions at the meeting focussed on the experience of Florida , which faced a similar insurance crisis after the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew .
According to the Insurance Information Institute , the LA losses easily exceeded those resulting from the 1965 Watts riots , also in Los Angeles .
The latest LA riots rank fifth in terms of catastrophic losses for the insurance industry .
This was followed by the Oakland fire disaster last year -LRB- Dollars 1.26bn -RRB- .
This takes the insurance bill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn , making it the costliest disaster to hit the US .
Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of insurance claims , yesterday 's figure comes from the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group , the property-casualty insurers ' trade association .
It follows an extensive survey of the area by the big insurance companies .
Mr Gary Kerney , director of catastrophe services at the PCS , said the industry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone .
By contrast , insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just Dollars 775m .
The property-casualty industry is thought to have adequate reserves to cover the disaster .
Some of those affected by the disaster claim that relief efforts have been disorganised , and that much-needed supplies have been slow to arrive .
On the insurance front , estimates of the industry 's losses have varied in recent days , but a consensus seems to be forming around the Dollars 10bn figure .
Although the damage from the hurricane 's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated , insurers ' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn , well below earlier expectations , a senior member of Lloyd 's insurance market said yesterday .
The new estimate , released yesterday by the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Service Group , an industry trade association , represents an increase from the original assessment of Dollars 7.8bn .
Many Wall Street analysts are suggesting the scale of the losses could prompt a turn in the US property-casualty industry cycle which would allow insurance companies to push up rates and move closer to making underwriting profits .
The storm system swept through southern Florida and Louisiana in late-August , causing massive damage and becoming the costliest disaster which the US insurance industry has ever faced .
S & P suggested yesterday that , if the after-tax charge from the hurricane was Dollars 1bn at Allstate , and the insurer loses around Dollars 1bn -LRB- under the statutory accounting principles common in the insurance industry , rather than GAAP -RRB- , this would raise the operating leverage ratio above three times , compared with 2.7 times in 1991 .
S & P currently has a AA minus claims-paying rating on Allstate Insurance Company , and its property-casualty subsidiaries .
However , many in the industry are already warning that expansion has been too quick and that the rapid supply of capital into the market could lead to a resumption of rate competition .
Andrew in particular , which with losses of more than Dollars 15bn is the US 's costliest natural disaster , has been a decisive factor prompting some reinsurance companies to leave the market .
Marsh McLennan , the world 's biggest insurance broker , and JP Morgan , the merchant bank , sponsored Mid-Ocean 's formation last November with capital of Dollars 350m .
Since the summer , US and overseas investors and insurance companies have been launching ventures at the rate of almost one a week in Bermuda .
Nevertheless many in the industry remain unconvinced that the new capacity will not affect rates .
Meanwhile , questions about New South Wales ' handling of the disaster are already being asked .
No one queries the dedication and skill with which fire- fighters tackled the blazes , but there are suggestions that inadequate forward preparation allowed the disaster to get out of hand .
Estimates of the cost to the insurance industry are being scaled back , for example .
The Insurance Council of Australia , the main industry group , said yesterday it now expected insured claims to total between ADollars 50m -LRB- Pounds 24m -RRB- and ADollars 100m , with most of this stemming from residential , rather than commercial , policies .
That said , insurers admit that it is still hard to assess the degree to which affected homeowners may have been either under-insured or without insurance altogether .
Mr Maurice Greenberg , chairman , said the strong quarterly and annual results reflected the increase in operating income reported by all of AIG 's three main businesses - general insurance , life insurance and financial services .
He singled out the performance of the group 's Asian operations , particularly its new life and non-life insurance operations in China , which he said had an 'outstanding ' debut .
Also , AIG said insurance rates had risen in several overseas markets .
General insurance premiums written by the group climbed almost 10 per cent to more than Dollars 10bn last year , which helped lift operating income from the general insurance business 28 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn .
Commenting on market conditions , Mr Maurice Greenberg , AIG 's chairman , said property insurance rates continued to strengthen in the domestic commercial market , a trend that should be reinforced as the industry absorbs the impact of the recent earthquake and weather-related catastrophes .
The group 's general insurance division recorded earnings of Dollars 349.5m , down slightly from Dollars 351.8m a year ago but up 12.5 per cent if the catastrophe business is excluded .
Life insurance earnings climbed 18 per cent to Dollars 194.4m , and financial services posted operating income of Dollars 97.1m , up 13 per cent from a year earlier .
Insurance companies operating in California are bracing themselves for legislation which would force them to offer earthquake cover .
After a meeting on Monday of Governor Pete Wilson and representatives of 18 insurance companies , a spokesman for Mr Wilson said 'some type of action , probably legislative action ' was likely .
Farmers , a subsidiary of the UK 's BAT Industries , had decided temporarily to stop writing homeowners ' insurance in the state .
At present , insurers are required by law in California to offer optional earthquake insurance to anyone who buys one of their homeowner policies .
That catastrophe cost the insurance industry more than Dollars 15bn , prompting insurers to abandon offering hurricane insurance in the state .
Zurich Insurance , the large Swiss company , owns a stake in Mr Sandor 's company , and others , including two UK brokers - Sedgwick and Willis Corroon - are also exploring the potential .
Underpinning the interest is the conviction that the capital base of the orthodox insurance and reinsurance industry is increasingly inadequate to cope with the scale of catastrophic risks , a fact graphically demonstrated by disasters in the US .
Mr Andrew Martin , managing director of Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy , says that the capital and surplus of the US property and casualty industry is estimated at Dollars 183bn , 'but many trillions of assets are insured and the risks exposed are increasing faster than insurers ' capital and capacity ' .
The Chicago Board of Trade contract is based on an index calculated by the Insurance Services Office -LRB- ISO -RRB- , a US industry body , and on the premiums received and claims paid by more than 24 US insurance companies .
Claims on a loss warranty policy are triggered by two sets of losses : those on the insurance policy of the buyer , and industry-wide claims .
In spite of industry scepticism , enthusiasts stress the attractions of the new products .
