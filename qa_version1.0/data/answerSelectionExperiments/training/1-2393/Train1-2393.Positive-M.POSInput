the IRON LADY ; A Biography of Margaret Thatcher by Hugo Young -LRB- Farrar , Straus & Giroux -RRB-
in this same revisionist mold , Hugo Young , the distinguished British journalist , has performed a brilliant dissection of the notion of Thatcher as a conservative icon .
in `` The Iron Lady , '' Young traces the winding staircase of fortune that transformed the younger daughter of a provincial English grocer into the greatest woman political leader since Catherine the Great .
`` He is the very essence of the classless meritocrat , '' says Hugo Young , Thatcher 's biographer .

France 's Peugeot will deliver diesel motors for these trucks .
a few cable lengths distant from the Pyramids , Peugeot opened the doors of its Cairo plant to the press on 26 January , for the launching of its `` made in Egypt `` 405 .
by 1995 , Peugeot aims to capture some 25 percent of the Egyptian market for personal automobiles .
Peugeot is increasing the capacity of its Canton plant , with plans calling for a capacity of 50,000 vehicles by 1995 .
a basic agreement has been signed for the building of a second ultramodern plant capable of manufacturing 100,000 Peugeot 405 sedans annually by the year 2000 .
in India , Peugeot plans to produce 60,000 Peugeot 309 sedans annually , near Bombay , beginning around the end of 1994 .
Peugeot TALBOT , the UK subsidiary of Peugeot , the French car maker , reported an 11 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from a record Pounds 123m to Pounds 109m in 1990 .
output rose by 8.5 per cent last year to 116,500 vehicles , the highest level achieved by the Ryton plant since 1971 .
importantly the company disclosed yesterday that it would revert to producing two model ranges at the Ryton assembly plant from mid-1992 , when it adds production of a new lower-medium segment car to the existing Peugeot 405 range .
the new range will replace the existing Peugeot 309 in the European market next year .
the 309 was produced at Ryton from 1986 to 1989 , when production was switched exclusively to the 405 in order to ease capacity constraints at Peugeot 's French assembly plants .
peugeot Talbot said yesterday that car production at Ryton was expected to fall by at least 23 per cent this year to about 90,000 in the face of declining new car demand in both the UK and continental European markets .
peugeot car sales in the UK last year fell by 11 per cent to 124,000 compared with a fall in the overall UK new car market of 12.7 per cent .
peugeot Citroen 's 1991 net profit was probably 'somewhat below ' that of the previous year , Mr Jacques Calvet , chairman of the French car maker , said yesterday , AP - DJ reports .
massimello agrees with Jean Yves Helmer , director in charge of the electric vehicles programme at France 's Peugeot , that by the end of the decade Europe overall will be providing a market of between 200,000 - 250,000 electric cars a year .
like Peugeot , Fiat stresses the financial burden of developing purpose-built EVs -LRB- electric vehicles -RRB- for a market that currently does not exist .
'but at a volume of 10,000 - 15,000 units a year it becomes financially viable to develop and manufacture purpose-built electric cars , ' says Panizza .
'ordinary ' cars such as Cinquecento or Peugeot 106 are not ideal for adaptation .
it is that contribution , notably the overseas shipment in recent years of seven out of every 10 cars that Peugeot Talbot produces at its Ryton plant near Coventry , which has led to its receipt of the Queen 's Award for exporting .
along the way , and partly as a reflection of its colourful , varied and sometimes troubled past , Peugeot Talbot has developed markets for its cars and parts not just in France and other EC states , but in Australasia , south-east Asia , Africa and Pakistan .
new markets are being found in eastern Europe , one of the world 's main potential growth areas for vehicles - at least in the long term - with Hungary and Czechoslovakia among the company 's Peugeot Talbot 's early targets .
in unit terms , the company 's export contribution last year amounted to 60,000 cars - all versions of the Peugeot 405 , the medium-sized saloon which is the only model currently produced by Peugeot Talbot 's 6,000 -strong UK workforce .
the decision to withdraw all design and development activities from the UK inevitably created fears that Peugeot Talbot would become just a sales company for foreign-built Peugeots .
peugeot agonised , looked at the industrial relations improvements being nurtured by Mr Whalen in his initial role as personnel director - and decided to invest Pounds 30m in re-equipping Ryton to produce a fully competitive car , the Peugeot 309 .
two years later , with the larger 405 proving one of Europe 's major success stories , Ryton was dedicated to producing the 405 exclusively .
next year , however , Peugeot Talbot 's own balance of trade pendulum should be swinging sharply towards the positive once more : Ryton is to become a two -model plant again , building the replacement for the 309 as well as the 405 .
when , as expected , the good times return to the UK new car market towards the mid-1990s , Peugeot Talbot is expected not only to have the capacity to make 200,000 cars a year , but actually to be using it .
that was nine years ago , and not long after he had parted company with car maker Peugeot Talbot as its sales operations director in the UK .
automobiles Peugeot , the French car maker , has joined forces with Inchcape , the British trading company , in an effort to boost car sales in Japan .
the two companies said yesterday they would invest more than Y2bn -LRB- Pounds 9.8m -RRB- in Peugeot Japon , which imports Peugeot cars into Japan .
signs of friction have emerged recently between Peugeot and Suzuki Motors , which sells Peugeot cars in its dealerships .
Peugeot and Rover last month ended an agreement under which Rover distributed Peugeot cars through its dealers in Japan .
Peugeot is hoping to capitalise on Inchcape 's experience in car distribution , as well as its extensive marketing experience in Japan in other product areas .
the move to bolster Peugeot sales comes when sales of Volkswagen - Audi cars , which together have 22.5 per cent of the import market , have been severely disrupted .
France 's three car makers , Peugeot , Citroen and state-owned Renault , have made big strides in productivity as they prepare to face the Japanese challenge in a liberalised European Community market .
last year , for example , the Peugeot group , which includes Citroen , maintains it produced the highest net margins of any car maker in the world , even after having suffered a 40 per cent decline in net earnings .
Peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per cent over the past five years , while Renault says it has improved its productivity by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per year over the same period .
Peugeot has abandoned the old style of quality control , whereby faults are identified and corrected in an enormous car park at the end of the production line .
automobiles Peugeot sold 2.4 per cent fewer new cars in Europe in 1992 as a disappointing showing in its domestic market overwhelmed a slight rise in other sales , Reuter reports from Paris .
the French company , the largest of two vehicle-making units within PSA Peugeot Citroen , said it sold 994,800 cars in 17 European countries in 1992 , down from 1,018 , 800 in 1991 .
these include Coca Cola and Pepsico , the US soft drinks giants , Peugeot , the French car manufacturer , finance companies GE Capital and Morgan Stanley , Nippon Denro , the Japanese steel manufacturer , and the Scotch whisky maker Seagram and United Distillers , the spirits arm of Guinness .
Peugeot of France will establish a joint venture with Indian car maker Premier Automobiles to produce 60,000 cars a year , introducing the Peugeot 309 and 205 models to India .
at Poissy , to the west of Paris , where the Peugeot 306 is manufactured , there will be 1,476 job losses .
Peugeot-Citroen , the private sector car manufacturer , is expected by industry observers to announce more than 4,000 job cuts next week in response to the depressed European car market .
the group , which manufactures parts for France 's two largest automobile groups , said that it was forced into the decision by an increasingly difficult financial situation and the failure of Renault and Peugeot to agree on a restructuring package .
these include the manufacture of parts for the Renault Trafic , a small van , and for a Peugeot utility vehicle .
until last March it had also produced parts for the Peugeot 205 .
one company , Yeu Tyan Machinery Manufacturing , assembles both Daihatsu and Peugeot vehicles .
Mr Longuet said Peugeot 's decision to stop manufacturing bodies for its 504 utility vehicle from the end of November left the fate of the company in Renault 's hands .
it manufactures body parts and components for cars , including Renault 's Trafic van .
Peugeot Talbot is to spend around Pounds 30m to start production of a saloon version of the Peugeot 306 hatchback early next year at its Ryton plant near Coventry .
the company said yesterday that the plant 's output was to be increased from 1,820 cars a week to 2,000 cars a week from January creating 'several hundred ' new jobs among Peugeot Talbot 's 70 component suppliers .
Peugeot Talbot , UK production and distribution subsidiary of the French vehicles group , expects the additional cars to lift Ryton 's total output from 73,000 this year to approaching 90,000 in 1995 and return the company to profitability .

Mr Peter Horne , Apricot managing director , said using new technology would cut costs and improve efficiency to the point where manufacturing costs in Scotland were lower than at Mitsubishi 's plants in either Singapore or Japan .
Dr Peter Horne , chairman of Apricot Computers , the UK -based workstation manufacturer owned by Mitsubishi of Japan , which turned over Pounds 45m last year , said it might mean an extra 1 per cent or 2 per cent on gross profit margins , but the effect would be swamped by the savage price-cutting which characterises the global personal computer business .
this is taking place at a time of rapid technological change and , said Dr Peter Horne , managing director of Apricot Computers , the information revolution will change the habit of companies doing most of their business in local markets .

Taiwan President Li Teng-hui went on a `` holiday diplomacy '' tour during the Spring Festival season .
He indirectly warned against inviting Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui to Tokyo saying that `` the Taiwan question has always been a very sensitive matter '' between Japan and China .
Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui Friday met his Indonesian counterpart Suharto during a lunch kept under tight wraps , a source here said .
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan flew to Phuket yesterday for a `` round of golf `` with visiting Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui , who is due to arrive today on an controversial private visit , an official source said yesterday .
The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok yesterday continued to show Peking 's `` concern `` about the private visit to Thailand of Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui next week .
Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui and Indonesian President Suharto discussed economic relations between the two countries , which have no diplomatic ties , a newspaper here said Saturday .
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , his wife , and 40 businessmen arrived in Phuket Province late this morning on a private vacation .
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , who arrived as a tourist , was welcomed only by Taiwanese businessmen at the airport .
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , accompanied by his wife and a 40 -member delegation , arrived in Phuket on Valentine 's Day .
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan played golf with visiting Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui in Phuket yesterday and described the meeting as a private one without political implications .
Speaking to reporters at the Foreign Ministry this afternoon about the PRC Government 's protest against the Thai Government 's reception of Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that he has already explained Thailand 's one - China policy .
Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun Kaeothong has denied a report that he is scheduled to hold talks on economic and investment issues with Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , who is on a vacation in Thailand .
The source said that even before the informal meeting between President Fidel Ramos and Taiwanese President Li Teng -hui on February 9 in Subic Freeport , 126 kilometers northwest of Manila , `` there had been low-key defense and military contacts between the two countries . ''
The private visit of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui has triggered strong reaction from the Chinese Government .
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday hit back at China for having rapped Bangkok over a private visit by Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui , saying the president was not a persona non grata and had every right to enter Thailand .
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui came to play golf , but those very unofficial , very private chats he had with top businessmen from three of China 's regional allies certainly roiled the waters .
The so-called `` holiday diplomacy '' trip to Thailand by Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui , which ended on Wednesday , has prompted some tough questions here .
A trusted economic adviser to President Li Teng-hui , Liang is the first native Taiwanese to fill the governor 's post .
The debate , which is over whether to allow the president to be elected by the Taiwanese people rather than by electoral college , was apparently initiated in early March by President Lee himself within the KMT leadership , and erupted into a public row during the party 's central committee plenum .
Although Mr Lee Teng -hui is the island 's first Taiwanese president , Mr Hau Pei -tsun , who as premier has effective day-to-day control over the island , and most of his senior cabinet are mainlanders .
Today , Taiwan is a quasi democracy with its first Taiwanese , as opposed to Chinese , president in Lee Teng -hui .
PRESIDENT Lee Teng-hui has taken a big step towards purging Taiwan of its political domination by the ageing supporters of Chiang Kai-shek , its founder , by appointing the first native Taiwanese , Mr Lien Chan , to be prime minister .
Taiwanese President Lee Teng -hui in a press conference yesterday again emphasised the need for mutual trust and recognition before these links are put into effect .
The tourist killings played into the hands of President Lee Teng-hui , who is using the incident to further his agenda of getting the world to recognise Taiwan as an independent sovereign state , observers say .
It is rumoured among Taipei politicians that shortly after Mr Lee became president following the death of Mr Chiang Ching -kuo in 1988 , opposition leaders asked him to seek formal Taiwanese independence from China .
Inside , the Japan Times ' main editorial turns its back on international affairs , despite the fact that this has been an interesting week , with a nasty row between China and Taiwan over whether Taiwanese President Lee Teng -hui should accept an invitation to the Asian games in Hiroshima early next month .
He is to meet Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui , Mr Lien Chan , the premier , and other officials .

Efforts to end the eight-day siege in Texas , US , by 400 FBI agents of a farm compound containing cult leader David Koresh and around 100 people , reached a stalemate .
Another child was released from the fortress in Waco , Texas , where cult leader David Koresh is refusing to surrender to federal agents who have been surrounding the site since a shoot-out on Sunday .
Nor , in other sharp exchanges , did she seek to shift any of the reponsibility for the bloody Waco denouement on to President Bill Clinton , the FBI , or any one other than David Koresh , the cult leader who died in the conflagration .
The ultimate responsibility for the deaths , however , was placed by the president with Mr David Koresh , the cult leader , who was believed to be among the dead and whom Mr Clinton described as 'dangerous , irrational and probably insane ' .
AP adds from Waco : The FBI yesterday denied responsibility for the Waco deaths and said Mr Koresh deliberately had his followers start the fire that killed them .
The cult leader , 33-year-old David Koresh , had 'lied ' as his last act , telling the FBI before the inferno that group 's children were safe in underground bunkers .
The compound housing an estimated 95 followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh was destroyed after three fires were started by members of the cult , possibly with kerosene , according to the FBI .
A fire , which the White House said was deliberately started by followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh , destroyed the compound where the cult members had been holed up .
There was no immediate indication of what happened to Mr Koresh , the religious leader who believes he is the incarnation of Jesus Christ .

Since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger visited China more than two decades ago , and since the 4 June incident , there have been frequent `` cold wars '' in Sino-U.S. relations , but never have they fallen out with each other .
According to John Crawshaw , president of Cargill Fertilizer 's Southeast Asian branch , the U.S. fertilizer giant shipped the first batch of American wheat to China in 1972 when the then U.S. President Richard Nixon made his first China visit .
China said Wednesday -LSB- 20 April -RSB- it hoped former US President Richard Nixon , whose historic 1972 visit here paved the way for the restoration of Sino - US ties , would recover soon from a severe stroke .
Nixon 's 1972 visit , during which he met with late chairman Mao Zedong , opened the door to the establishment of full Sino - US diplomatic relations seven years later .
Nixon is best remembered in China for his historic 1972 visit here which ended decades of mutual hostility and paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later .
Mr. Nixon was the first U.S. President after World War II to visit China 22 years ago .
His historic visit to China in 1972 must be the most eye-catching event .
Nixon 's trip to China in 1972 not only changed international relations at that time , but also had an impact on the global strategic pattern in the last three decades of the 20th century , and even in the 21st century .
Nixon 's visit to China 23 years ago opened up a new chapter in Sino-U.S. relations .
Yu recalled that there were no ties between China and the United States in 1972 , when former U.S. President Nixon and former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger paid their visit to China .
More than 20 years have elapsed since Nixon 's world-shaking visit to China .
Only after Nixon visited China in 1972 did Japan normalize diplomatic relations with China .
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng praised Mr Nixon for his 1972 breakthrough visit to Beijing that began rapprochement between China and the US and for his efforts to improve relations even after he resigned .
Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing during his historic 1972 visit to China , neither he nor his successor , President Gerald R. Ford , was able to establish diplomatic relations with the Communist regime .
After Nixon 's visit to China in the early 1970s , 40 U.S. cities established ties with municipalities there .
1972 : After Chinese and U.S. diplomatic feelers , President Richard Nixon visits Beijing in 1972 , launching Sino-U.S. reconciliation after years of hostility .
Starting with President Richard M. Nixon 's visit to China in February , 1972 , there have been seven Sino - American summits .
This began in earnest with Richard M. Nixon 's visit to , and subsequent recognition of , Communist China in 1972 .
1972 -- Nixon reelected in a landslide , defeating McGovern ; becomes first U.S. President to visit China while in office .

Nixon 's historic 1972 visit to China , the opera will have five performances beginning Sept. 11 , delayed from the previous season so that it could be part of the current Los Angeles Festival , also directed by Sellars .
A member of the Nixon party who attended the meeting between Deng and the American leader who opened the door to China in 1972 characterized their conversation as a `` a very tough , no-holds-barred exchange . ''
Nixon , in his comments to Deng , warned the 85-year-old leader that in the 17 years since his 1972 visit to Beijing , `` there has never been a more difficult crisis '' in relations between the United States and China .
In February , 1972 , he first went to China in the shadow of sagging popularity polls and uncertainty at home .

The new Lander have to be completely rebuilt and there are enormous fortunes to be made by those willing to take risks on the future development of Berlin - with 3.4m inhabitants Germany 's largest city and the future seat of government - and cities such as Leipzig and Dresden .
The 1991 election in Hamburg , Germany 's second largest city after Berlin , was won by the SPD , with an absolute majority of just one seat , but it could now face serious defections because of the disarray of the party at national level .
Berlin has also suffered as a result of the recession , but the political doubts hanging over the city 's future - another negative for the office property market - have to some extent been lifted by the German parliament 's reaffirmation that Berlin will become reunited Germany 's capital by the end of the decade .

The North Koreans have insisted that the two US pilots - one of whom was killed when their helicopter came down - were on a spying mission and they published a 'confession ' from Mr Hall .
US army pilot Bobby Hall , in his first debriefing by US officials since being freed by North Korea , said his helicopter was hit by air defences after it strayed across the border , forcing him into an emergency landing .
At the time of the shooting-down , Mr Hall thought he was over South Korea and apparently did not realise his helicopter had been struck and that Mr Hilemon had been hit , the official said .
North Korea has said that it has delayed the repatriation of the captured pilot , Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall , because he has not co-operated in its investigation of the straying of the OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter into its airspace .

He said the troops and guards had been placed under a single , unified command under the overall supervision of General Colin Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Mr Bush 's decision to deploy extra resources was taken after two White House meetings , the first of which involved his domestic advisers , including Gen Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , and the second with black civil rights leaders .
Born in Warsaw of a Polish mother and Georgian father , the 55-year-old Gen Shalikashvili formerly commanded the US 7th Army in Germany and is currently senior assistant to Gen Colin Powell , chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff .
If General Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and Gulf war hero , ran with Mr Bush it might be easy to argue that ditching Mr Quayle was not an act of desperation .
In the US , General Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , added his voice to the US administration 's criticism of the expulsions .
At his press conference with Mr John Major , the British prime minister , on Wednesday afternoon , he said he had been assured by General Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , that operations could be conducted at minimal risk to US pilots .
GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , but flatly denied this was because of disagreements with the Clinton administration .

Aung San Suu Kyi , 48 , a Nobel peace prize laureate , led the National League for Democracy -LRB- NLD -RRB- to a landslide victory in the 1991 general election but was denied the power to head the government .
They ambiguously explained that Suu Kyi , the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the most outspoken critic of the military 's heavy-handed policies against pro-democracy demonstrations can be held up to six years according to `` existing laws '' .
The diplomat predicted Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi , whose National Democratic League -LRB- NLD -RRB- overwhelmingly won elections in 1990 , would remain under house arrest though her sentence technically ends next July .
Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate , has been under house arrest in Yangon since July 1989 .
It has kept the 1991 Nobel peace prize winner , Aung San Suu Kyi - leader of the opposition party which won a landslide victory in the poll - under house arrest since July 1989 .
The regime , which is also engaged in a battle with insurgents near its eastern border with Thailand , ignored a 1990 election victory by an opposition party and is detaining its leader , Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , who was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize .
In addition , the Slorc does not know what to do about Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 .
But many foreign investors remain sceptical , and western governments are withholding aid because of the Slorc 's dismal human rights record and the continued detention of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the opposition leader who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 .
The Burmese junta , isolated by the west because of its miserable human rights record and its failure to release Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the detained opposition leader who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize , has found a powerful friend in China .

Typical of that trend , White said , is the lowering of the legal blood alcohol standard for drunk drivers to 0.08 % , which is expected to result in more drunk-driving convictions statewide while having less impact in Ventura County , where prosecutors already file drunk-driving charges on blood-alcohol levels as low as 0.06 % .
The legal limit under California law is 0.10 % .
A blood-alcohol level of 0.10 % is considered legally drunk .
Former Ram offensive lineman Doug France had a blood-alcohol level of at least .13 -- well above the legal limit of .08 -- when he was involved in a two -car crash that killed a Laguna Hills woman , the California Highway Patrol said Tuesday .
Under state law , the legal limit at which a person is considered to be driving under the influence of alcohol is .10
In January , after a vote by the state Legislature , the legal limit for alcohol in a driver 's bloodstream dropped from .10 % percent to .08 % .
If Rausis ' blood-alcohol exceeded 0.10 % , the limit allow by California law , he could have faced felony charges of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter .
With a stern warning to drinkers to stay off the road , Gov. George Deukmejian signed legislation Friday to toughen California 's drunk driving standard -- dropping the legal blood alcohol level from .10 % to .08 %
California law recognizes .10 as the legal limit .
The legal limit in California is 0.10 .
This year in California there have been several significant changes in the drunk driving laws , most notably the new , lower blood alcohol level of .08 % as the legal limit .
Another new state law enacted in July , called the Admin Per Se Law , gives police and CHP the authority to take away a person 's driver 's license immediately if their blood alcohol level is .10 % or higher , Marinez said .
Under the new law , the existing blood alcohol standard of .10 will drop to .08 .
Drunk drivers will have one more obstacle come midnight , as a new state law takes effect that lowers the legal blood alcohol limit from 0.10 to 0.08 .

The Bundesbank 's 1992 M3 growth target is 3.5 to 5.5 pct .
Its target range for M3 growth of 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent in 1992 refers to growth relative to the average level of M3 in the fourth quarter of 1991 .
Today , when M3 , the broad monetary aggregate , is racing away at a near double-digit annual rate - twice the centre point of the target range for this year of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent - and inflation is higher than in Britain and France , Germany 's money supply is one of the most closely watched financial indicators .
The target range for M3 growth in 1992 is 4 - 6 per cent .
The acceleration of German broad money growth this year , combined with the Bundesbank 's recent reaffirmation of its 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent target range for 1992 M3 growth in 1992 , suggest that policy in the ERM will remain tight for some time .
The problem , however , recognised by Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger and his colleagues , is that its target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for M3 growth in 1992 looks embarrassing in view of this year 's monetary pace .
It is the rapid growth in M3 , at a higher than expected annualised rate of 9 per cent in August against a 1992 target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent , that mainly lies behind the Bundesbank 's determination to keep interest rates high .
Growth of D -Mark M3 at a provisional annual rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and July remains well above the official target of 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 per cent , which is based on what the Bundesbank thinks will give medium term inflation of 2 per cent .
The central bank 's tough interest-rate policy has been based largely on its concern that M3 growth at 9 per cent was well outside its target range of 3.5 - 5.5 per cent .
The Bundesbank added its money supply target for 1993 would be raised to a range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent , from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent .
The Bank of France has a target of 4 to 6 per cent for annual M3 growth in 1992 .
Interest rate hopes foundered on M3 growth of 10.2 per cent in October against 9.3 per cent in September and a Bundesbank target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for 1992 .
Last year M3 grew at 9.4 per cent compared to a target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent , the worst performance since targeting was introduced 18 years before .

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea five years ago : `` A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is more than probable .
Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 0840 GMT on 19 February broadcasts an ecological program `` People 's Earth , '' which carries a 10-minute feature on the continuing investigation into the sinking of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine on 7 April 1989 in the Norwegian Sea near Medvezhiy island .
The author of this book -- the assistant chief designer of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' -- offers his interpretation of the tragedy that played itself out in the Sea of Norway on 7 April 1989 .
From the Author : On 7 April 1989 an accident occurred aboard the Soviet nuclear- powered submarine `` Komsomolets '' in the Sea of Norway , as a result of which the submarine sank , and a large part of its crew tragically perished .
D. A. Romanov Foreword : This work by marine engineer and submarine designer D. A. Romanov is devoted to a tragic event in the history of the Soviet Navy -- the disaster that occurred on 7 April 1989 in the Sea of Norway with the deep-sea nuclear-powered submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
Russian specialists and scientists have proposed a unique method of preserving the submarine Komsomolets which sank 7 April 1989 in the Norwegian Sea approximately 180 miles southeast of Bear Island .
The nuclear submarine Komsomolets has now been lying on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea for almost five years .
-LSB- 080329 -RSB- -LSB- Klado over video of submarine disappearing under water , shoals of fish , latest pictures of sunken Komsomolets submarine -RSB- The Soviet nuclear submarine Komsomolets caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea 7 April 1989 .
The nuclear warheads of the torpedoes in the nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sank exactly five years ago in the Norwegian Sea remain intact .
Russia 's Ministry for Emergencies plans to buy equipment that will make live telecast possible from the nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sunk in the Norwegian sea on April 7 , 1989 .
The Committee for the Conduct of Special Work -LRB- KOPRON -RRB- under the Russian Federation Government has totally completed the study of materials associated with the investigation of the nuclear submarine `` Komsomolets `` that was lost in the Norwegian Sea on 7 April 1989 .

The federal government 's decision of 8 December 1993 to implement the Berlin - Hamburg high-speed maglev railway cleared the way for the first application of maglev railway technology in Germany .
I am convinced that the implementation of the Berlin - Hamburg high-speed maglev railway through the joint initiative of the federal government , the states taking part and German industry will be a sign visible worldwide of the achievement and innovation strength of Germany as a technology and industrial base .
Germany 's 'whispering arrow ' , a 400kph -LRB- 250mph -RRB- levitating magnetic hovertrain , could be flying by the end of the decade , writes Christopher Parkes .
The Railway Technical Research Institute , a JR affiliate with national and local government support , is conducting the more ambitious of Japan 's two magnetic levitation -LRB- maglev -RRB- linear railway development projects .
A potentially worrying development for the European task force is the development by Germany of magnetic levitation technology whereby trains run on a magnetic cushion above a monorail .
The German government gave its approval two months ago for the world 's first commercial 'maglev ' train to run between Berlin and Hamburg at speeds of up to 250 mph .
The Transrapid will be the world 's first long-distance transport system propelled by magnetic levitation , a technology that Thyssen , the German conglomerate , has been developing .
On Wednesday , they rode West Germany 's magnetically levitated high-speed train .
-Capital costs are less than West German 's experimental magnetic-levitation train system .
Bechtel envisions using magnetic-levitation technology now being tested on a 20-mile track in West Germany .
Perini 's Cygan said his firm and partners Daniel , Mann , Johnson & Mendenhall have not decided whether to use German or Japanese magnetic-levitation technology , but that they `` have pretty much ruled out monorail , light-rail and heavy rail .

The Uzbekistan , the land of the builders of India 's historic Taj Mahal , offers a very lucrative mosaic of opportunities to Indian entrepreneurs , businessmen , and industrialists .
The UNESCO list of more than 360 sites throughout the world includes the Great Barrier Reef in Australia , the Taj Mahal in India , Chartres Cathedral in France , and Serengeti National Park in Tanzania .
And of course , India has the Taj Mahal .
Seven people died and 50 were reported missing because a low-caste 15-year-old bridegroom from India 's Taj Mahal town of Agra wanted to ride to his wedding on horseback , a local member of Parliament said today .
As the world knows , the Taj Mahal was built as a tomb by the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan in Agra on the banks of the Jamuna River after the demise of his favorite wife , Mumtaz Mahal .
The Taj Mahal city of Agra has become a virtual ghost town after at least 11 people were killed there in the Hindu - Muslim violence gripping India .
The official appeared to be referring to fears that Hindu extremists might make a target of the Taj Mahal , one of the few popular destinations left for tourists visiting India .

Since 1985 New Zealand has been excluded from the Anzus -LRB- Australia , New Zealand and US -RRB- defence pact because of its anti-nuclear policies .
New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear laws in 1985 which the U.S. says prevents their ships coming here and has resulted in Wellington being frozen out of the Anzus -LRB- Australia , New Zealand and U.S. -RRB- Pact .
Political differences became intense in the mid-1980s , over defence , highlighted by New Zealand 's withdrawal from ANZUS , the pact with Australia and the US .
The United States has effectively suspended New Zealand from the alliance since 1985 , after Wellington banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons .
The United States in 1986 cut high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped the country from the ANZUS military alliance , which also includes Australia .
Baker , Cheney , Evans and Australian Defense Minister Kim Beazley attended the annual meeting to set policy for the alliance , which is still known as ANZUS -LRB- for Australia , New Zealand and the United States -RRB- despite New Zealand 's suspension in 1987 .

Steve Garvey played tennis while engaged in baseball but , pursuing Lou Gehrig 's record of 2,130 consecutive games , refrained from doing household chores .
Joe DiMaggio is remembered for hitting in 56 consecutive games , Lou Gehrig for playing in 2,130 consecutive games .
Ripken is more than halfway to Lou Gehrig 's record of 2,130 consecutive games .
It took 14 years , 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on the bench .
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of baseball 's unbreakable records .
Fifty years ago today : Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees did not play against the Detroit Tigers at Briggs Stadium , thus ending his streak of 2,130 consecutive games played .
Fifty years ago this week , Lou Gehrig ended a remarkable string of playing in 2,130 consecutive games , from June 1 , 1925 to May 2 , 1939 .
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. played in his 1 , 307th straight game , putting him in a tie for second with Everett Scott behind Lou Gehrig -LRB- 2,130 games -RRB- on baseball 's all-time list of consecutive games played .
Ripken is 822 games -- or more than five seasons -- way from Gehrig 's record of 2,130 .
Lou stayed there for 2,130 consecutive games or 14 seasons .
In that time , he broke Lou Gehrig 's consecutive game record of 2,130 with 2,215 of his own , and even kept playing the day after a pitch struck him and broke his left collarbone .
`` Lou had played in 2130 consecutive games .
Not since Lou Gehrig 's incredible 2,130 consecutive-game record ended 50 years ago has there been a streak of this duration .
Chasing the Horse : Cal Ripken 's move into third place last week in consecutive games played has , naturally , raised the question of his possibly catching Lou Gehrig , whose record of 2,130 straight games has long been looked upon as unassailable .

Louisiana Republicans on Saturday endorsed a New Orleans state senator to challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston , decisively rejecting a bid by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke , who is now a state representative .
Treen , 63 , and Duke , 38 , a former grand wizard of the klan , are in a runoff election Saturday to represent the nearly all-white district in Metairie , a New Orleans suburb .
Former national Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke , running against a local businessman who received endorsements from President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan , captured a hotly contested seat in the Louisiana Legislature by 224 votes Saturday .
Duke , who said he left the klan in 1980 but still lists his home phone number as the New Orleans klan office , delivered a blow to local , state and national Republican leaders with the victory Saturday .
David Duke , a former grand wizard in the Ku Klux Klan , and home builder John Treen faced off Saturday for a seat in the Louisiana Legislature in an election peppered with charges of racism and extremism .
The election returned the spotlight to Duke , who in the 1970s was photographed in a Nazi uniform and boldly removed the hood of his white robe to become an international spokesman for the klan .
David Duke 's opponent filed a court motion seeking to block the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard from taking the Louisiana Legislature seat he won Saturday .
Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke overcame two last-minute efforts to block him from taking his newly won seat in the Legislature today and was sworn in as a member of the Louisiana House .
The national Republican Party leadership , spurred by chairman Lee Atwater , today cut all ties to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke , the newly elected Louisiana Republican state lawmaker .
Duke , 38 , a former klan grand wizard , was elected to the Legislature Saturday from a suburban New Orleans district in a narrow victory over builder John Treen , 63 , who was backed by President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan .
Duke , a former member of the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan , was elected this month to the Louisiana Legislature as a member of the Republican Party .
Duke then billed himself as executive director and grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , always being careful to explain that it was one of several Klan groups in the country .
David Duke , the former Ku Klux Klan leader elected last month to the Louisiana House of Representatives , called the Rev. Jesse Jackson a `` racist '' and said affirmative action and minority set-aside programs should be abolished .
To the `` Not-sees , '' Skinheads , Ku Klux Klan , David Duke , and other bigoted , racist know-nothings : `` Foiled again ! ''
A month earlier , one-time Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke won election to the Louisiana Legislature as a Republican , despite opposition from Bush and Atwater .
The Louisiana House killed a bill that would have abolished state affirmative action programs , handing state Rep. David Duke , a former Ku Klux Klan leader , his first legislative defeat since winning his seat in a special election in February .
State Rep. David Duke , 39 , the former Ku Klux Klan leader who became a Republican in 1988 , is challenging three -term Democratic incumbent J. Bennett Johnston .
David Duke -- former Ku Klux Klan leader , anti- Semite , smut peddler , fabulist -- does cosmetic surgery on his face and his past and gets 60 % of the white vote in Louisiana in a U.S. Senate race .
When former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican , Bush and other GOP leaders were sincerely horrified and rushed to repudiate him .
Seated in the visitors ' gallery were both David Duke , the former Ku Klux Klan leader and defeated Louisiana Republican senatorial candidate , and the Rev. Jesse Jackson , a prominent civil rights advocate and `` shadow '' Senate candidate from the District of Columbia .
Glenn Montecino , an aide to state representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke , said moving the obelisk could mean the construction project will lose federal funds since it could be a candidate for the National Register of Historic Places .
Duke , former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , founded the NAAWP after repudiating the klan .

Morris , suspended from graduate studies at Cornell University at Syracuse , N. Y. , is accused of designing and disseminating in November , 1988 , a rogue program or `` worm `` that immobilized some 6,000 computers linked to a research network , including some used by NASA and the Air Force .
Cornell graduate student Robert Morris alone created the program that infected thousands of military and university computers , the panel 's report said .
Morris , 23 , who is on a leave of absence from the school 's doctoral program in computer science , refused to be interviewed by the commission , which was left to speculate as to the reasons Morris created the `` worm , '' an independent program that endlessly duplicates itself once placed in a computer system -- as opposed to a `` virus , '' which inserts itself into a host program to propagate .
The commission found that Morris probably wanted to spread the `` worm `` without detection but that , once it had been unleashed , he made only `` minimal efforts '' to stop its spread .

The effects on man are known mainly from examinations of the population of Seveso , chemical industry workers , and Vietnam veterans -LRB- the defoliant Agent Orange was contaminated with dioxins -RRB- .
Dioxins first came to public attention when they were found to be a contaminant in a defoliant called Agent Orange , used by the US during the Vietnam war .
In a significant shift in federal policy , Vietnam veterans suffering from a rare form of cancer that they claim was caused by exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange will receive full disability benefits , Veterans Affairs officials announced Thursday .
Nearly 36,000 Vietnam veterans have applied for VA benefits on claims that they contracted cancer or other maladies as a result of exposure to Agent Orange , a defoliant containing dioxin , a highly toxic agent that was widely sprayed in Vietnam from 1961 to 1972 .
Thousands of Vietnam veterans who claim Agent Orange -related health problems are eligible for compensation from a $ 180-million fund established by seven chemical companies that produced the defoliant .
The U.S. government sprayed Agent Orange over much of Vietnam during the 1960s to destroy fields and deprive communist troops of valuable forest cover .
Agent Orange , whose toxic ingredient is dioxin , was used as a defoliant by the United States in Vietnam .
Although other factors have played their part in the destruction , much of it was caused by heavy bombing and the U.S. use of the defoliant Agent Orange during the war .
joined two colleagues Thursday in introducing a bill to provide disability benefits for Vietnam War combat veterans suffering from diseases they link to exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange .
Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during the Vietnam War .
Agent Orange : Passed and sent to the Assembly on a 37-0 vote a resolution -LRB- SCR 116 -RRB- by Sen. Cecil Green -LRB- D - Norwalk -RRB- urging President Bush and the Congress to enact legislation providing benefits to Vietnam War veterans who were exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange .

GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas took a giant stride yesterday towards becoming the Democratic party 's nominee for the US presidential election in November .
Apostles of the movement include some of the most innovative state governors in the country , both Democratic and Republican : Mr Bill Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee and Arkansas Governor ; Mr William Weld , the Republican who is shaking up Massachusetts ; Mr Lawton Chiles , the Democrat who is reshaping Florida 's civil service ; and Mrs Ann Richards , the Democrat running Texas .
But the cutting edge of the reform movement can be seen in Massachusetts , where the Republican Mr Weld took over as governor at the start of last year in a wave of revulsion by voters against the high tax regime of his predecessor , Mr Michael Dukakis , the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee .
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas last night set out to reintroduce himself to American voters as he accepted the Democratic party 's nomination to be its presidential candidate .
An easing would immediately benefit the short end of the market , but the long end faces residual concerns about inflation which may intensify in the final weeks of the presidential election campaign if Mr Bill Clinton , the Democratic nominee , sustains his lead in the opinion polls .
But polls suggest the idea is extremely popular around the nation and it is likely to become law if Bill Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee , wins the November election .
The poll , conducted for the Boston Globe newspaper , found that if the US presidential election were held today , Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and his running- mate , Senator Al Gore , would beat Mr Bush and Vice-President Dan Quayle by 56 to 32 per cent of the vote .
His new-found celebrity beyond the canyons of lower Manhattan stems from the significant behind-the-scenes role he is playing in the election campaign of Mr Bill Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee .
An estimated 80 per cent of native American voters backed Mr Clinton in the 1992 presidential election , but tribal leaders have been disappointed at the Democratic administration 's plans to cut the budget for the Indian Health Services - which administration officials have now indicated they are rethinking - and at delays in naming a new chairman for the National Indian Gaming Commission .
But he suggested that a proclamation before the American elections may be used by -LRB- George S. -RRB- McGovern , the Democratic presidential candidate , as proof of the failure of -LRB- Nixon 's -RRB- foreign policy .
More recently , Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis rode the very same rails as Van de Kamp during the 1988 presidential campaign .
His quest for the governorship was endorsed earlier in the day by the National Latino Peace Officers Assn. , a group that has backed Van de Kamp twice for attorney general and that last year supported Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis .

The state news agency Tanjug said at least three people were killed and five injured Wednesday in Glogovac , a village 12 miles south of Pristina , capital of Kosovo .
Thousands of Serbs had rallied for three days in Kosovo Polje , a suburb of the provincial capital of Pristina , demanding a curfew and protesting what they claimed were threats by ethnic Albanian `` separatists and terrorists . ''

THE total value of precious gems smuggled out of Sri Lanka could be as high as Colombo 's annual foreign aid receipts , says a former governor of the country 's central bank and an expert in the gem trade .
In that period , many foreign ships bypassed Colombo , and export shipments vital to Sri Lanka 's economy were delayed .
He said two new shipping lines plying through Colombo , coupled with Sri Lanka 's deregulation of export shipments , should boost the port 's business .
Sri Lanka gets brief coverage , and the narration points out its current troubles while showing scenes of the capital city of Colombo and rural farms , where methods have remained unchanged for centuries .
Leaders of both militant groups argue that they have been shortchanged by the ruling elite in Sri Lanka 's capital , Colombo .
Rebels stopped three buses and gunned down at least 35 Muslim passengers in eastern Sri Lanka , Defense Ministry officials in Colombo said .

Two Sinhalese radicals burst into the home of a prominent broadcaster and shot him to death near Colombo , Sri Lanka 's capital , military officials said .

Soviet diplomats in Washington sounded out the Nixon Administration in 1969 , former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger recalls in his memoirs , and they were told emphatically of U.S. opposition to such an action .
The two men , both former aides to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger during the Nixon Administration 's opening to China , made secretly planned trips to Beijing on Bush 's behalf last July and December .
During the Nixon Administration , the Chinese chose Kissinger , then the national security adviser , over Secretary of State William P. Rogers .

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping agreed today to restore friendly ties between the world 's most populous countries despite a long-standing border dispute .
Suraj Prakash Malhotra , a local leader of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 's Congress Party , and Gajjan Singh , a state leader of the Communist Party of India , were among the victims in a series of attacks , Press Trust of India said .
The Election Commission tossed out thousands of suspected fraudalent ballots cast Wednesday at more than 600 polling booths in six states and sent a team to investigate charges of vote fraud in the Amethi constituency , where Gandhi is facing Raj Mohan Gandhi , the grandson of India 's beloved independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi .
Hosting a banquet for the visiting leader , Mr. Rao said India looked forward to a further expansion of relations with the ASEAN , with which it was a sectoral dialogue partner .
The federal government and German industry were following India 's policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and `` modern India , with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at liberalisation , is one of our most important partners on the Asian continent , '' the German leader told Mr Rao .
On that day , Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , the Hindu leader of India 's movement for independence , said : `` At the strike of the midnight hour , when the world sleeps , India will awake to life and freedom .
The election also was billed as a report card on Gandhi 's five years in power , during which the young leader had vowed to usher in a new era of science and prosperity in long-impoverished India .
With Parliament set to resume on Thursday , the Congress Party leadership is working under a deadline in which it will either choose the leader and present the choice as a fait accompli to lawmakers , or leave it up to the rank-and-file members of the party , who are seeking a stronger voice in the control of India 's dominant party after Rajiv Gandhi 's death .
While Gorbachev 's visit to India last week underscored close ties between Moscow and New Delhi , the Soviet leader and Prime Minister Gandhi fell short of affirming each other 's positions on Asia .

The Tokyo - Osaka corridor covers more than 70 percent of Japan 's 120 million population , and the new companies are offering long-distance rates about 20 percent lower than NTT .
The Home Affairs Ministry said last month Japan 's population was 122.74 million at the end of March .
Partly because of such sentiments , officials acknowledge difficulty in annually recruiting 20,000 new soldiers from Japan 's population more than 120 million people .
The league , which claims 200,000 members , has fought discrimination faced by burakumin , a former outcast group estimated to number between 1 million and 3 million out of Japan 's total population of 123 million .
The number of such workers is small compared with Japan 's population -- roughly 122 million people -- but it has soared as Japan has become a nation of high wages , labor shortages and a strong currency .
The latest report , for the year ended March 31 , listed Japan 's population at 122.7 million .
To make the comparison equivalent in terms of population , I 've thrown in Norway , which brings the three in Europe to a population figure identical with Japan 's 124 million .

Justice Minister Albin Chalandon compared the president 's relationship with the French to that of Marshal Philippe Petain , head of the Vichy France government that collaborated with the German occupation in World War II .
In 1945 , the former premier of Vichy France , Pierre Laval , was executed .
France observed the 50th anniversary of the formation of the collaborationist Vichy government Tuesday and honored the Parliament members who opposed Marshal Philippe Petain 's ascension to power .
In August 1944 , as Allied forces swept through France , Petain fled Vichy and was arrested , then was allowed to leave for Switzerland .
Though coincidental , the death of Bousquet and the introduction of a remembrance day for Vichy 's victims have dramatised a national dilemma for France in which history , morality and politics each plays a part : the dilemma of whether Vichy , the wartime government of Marshal Philippe Petain , which sought to lead a defeated and part-occupied France along the 'way of collaboration ' with Hitler , is a chapter of French history best remembered , or best forgotten .
They still have difficulty facing up to what happened between the fall of France in 1940 and the liberation of Paris in 1944 , when the Vichy government of Marshal Petain submitted to the Nazi victors .

Pluto , which is thought to be half ice and half rock , usually is thought of as the ninth planet from the sun , but because it has an elongated elliptical orbit , it will be the eighth planet from the sun until 1990 , when it heads outward beyond Neptune 's orbit .
But because Pluto 's elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun , Neptune currently is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun .

Voyager 1 visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 , and now is speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after it stops studying Neptune on Oct. 2 . Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun , but Pluto 's elliptical orbit means it now is closer , making Neptune temporarily the solar system 's outmost planet .
Pluto normally is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun .
Mercury , the innermost planet , will be too close to the sun to be distinguished by Voyager 's cameras and Pluto is too far away and too small to show up in images .
Among them are the clearest pictures yet of Pluto , the farthest planet from the sun in the solar system , and its moon Charon .
That is because the highly elliptical orbit that Pluto follows brings it inside the orbit of Neptune for perihelion , making it the eighth planet from the sun , not the ninth .

Barely 10 months later , Nixon faced three impeachment charges before becoming the first president to resign .
In October 1974 , two months after the Watergate scandal forced President Richard Nixon to resign from office , the Oakland A 's won the World Series .
But gradually , expertly recreating Nixon 's awkward , hunch-backed walk and gestures , Smith becomes eminently convincing as the driven , agonized man who became the only American president to ever resign from office .
Ambrose , who wrote an admiring two -volume biography of Dwight Eisenhower before taking on Nixon , said his revised estimate of the first U.S. president to resign from office stemmed from `` the fact he is not in active politics anymore and I am trying to look at him as a historian rather than as a citizen .

The pins are popular with conservatives `` who wish he was doing our negotiating with the Russians instead of the people we have now , '' said Stanley , who made news in 1984 when she resigned from the state Republican Central Committee to support Democrat Geraldine Ferraro for vice president .
Sasso , who took a leave from his statehouse post to manage Geraldine Ferraro 's unsuccessful 1984 vice presidential campaign , was among the first to urge Dukakis to run for president .
The phrase `` deep doo-doo '' has been attributed to the vice president , and after his debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 he said he had `` kicked ass. ''
He helped prepare Geraldine Ferraro for her debate with the vice president in October 1984 .
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro , July 19 , 1984 , accepting the Democratic Party nomination for vice president .
Martin supported Bush in his 1980 presidential bid , helped him prepare for his 1984 vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and was a national co- chairwoman of his 1988 run for the White House .
`` I always said I had two role models in life , '' said Geraldine Ferraro , the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1984 .
When Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice president in 1984 , the `` women 's vote '' was billed as the sleeping giant that would awaken and save the Democratic Party .
`` I will not dignify those theories except to assure you that I am not imagining the conduct to which I testified , '' she said in a news conference Monday . ; While the sexual harassment issue hit a raw nerve in the country , and mobilized many liberal women 's groups and legal professionals on Hill 's behalf , the case showed , as did Geraldine Ferraro 's candidacy for vice president in 1984 , that women do not necessarily side with women just because they are women . ;
Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for vice president in 1984 but the ticket led by Walter Mondale was defeated .

Gabrielle and Hugo are the seventh and eighth named storms of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season .
Hugo is the eighth named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season .
St. Croix Cable TV agreed to buy a Virgin Islands FM radio station that halted operations in September after being severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 .
Between 1987 and 1990 reinsurers in the retrocession market , much of which is concentrated at Lloyd 's of London , were hit by a string of catastrophe losses - ranging from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in the North Sea in 1988 , to hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the January storms in 1990 .
They are in desperate straits as the claims from catastrophes at the end of 1989 and beginning of 1990 - Hurricane Hugo , the San Francisco earthquake , a Phillips Petroleum explosion in Texas and storms in January 1990 - come home to roost .
Mr Lloyd-Roberts said Lloyd 's was less exposed to Hurricane Andrew than it was to Hurricane Hugo , which caused claims of more than Dollars 5bn in 1989 .
Hurricane Hugo , which hit the east coast in September 1989 , cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn .
This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989 , when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California .
That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n -LRB- Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn -RRB- of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane , Hugo , which hit South Carolina in 1989 .
The syndicate 's own reinsurance was insufficient to cover losses stemming from hurricane Hugo in 1989 , the European storms of 1990 and a string of other losses .
Insurers could restrict coverage to a percentage of the sum insured in some areas or follow the example of insurers in the Virgin Islands - badly hit by hurricane Hugo in 1989 - where excesses are a percentage of the property 's value .
That storm was almost exactly the strength of Hurricane Hugo , which hit in South Carolina with 135 mph winds in September 1989 .
Though it is party time again on St. Croix , the storm remains a sobering presence ; you never sit long at one of the numerous waterfront bars without hearing another Hugo story. ; Hours of destruction ; Hurricane Hugo roared into St. Croix on the night of Sept. 17 , 1989 .
And it was done , despite Hurricane Hugo in the fall of 1989 .
Finally , unmentioned by the Journal , Hurricane Hugo leveled both Interco 's large Converse manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico and its distribution center in South Carolina on the same day in 1989 .
By comparison , Hurricane Hugo , which hit several islands in the Caribbean and Charleston , S.C. , in 1989 , resulted in claims to insurers of $ 4 billion , Mr. Frinquelli said .
`` While Hurricane Bob 's damage did not approach the catastrophic levels of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , this storm still had a significant impact on thousands of Aetna policyholders , '' said David A. Kocher , Aetna group executive .
In 1989 , Hurricane Hugo wiped out more than three-quarters of its Virgin Islands phone lines .

Legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.65 over the next three years has won House subcommittee approval , but organized labor failed in a bid to tie future increases to inflation .
The Senate Labor Committee voted 11-5 today to approve legislation that would increase the current $ 3.35 an hour federal minimum wage by $ 1.20 over the next three years .
The minimum wage has been $ 3.35 since 1981 .
Both the House-passed bill and the amendments Kennedy promised to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 3.85 on Oct. 1 , to $ 4.25 on Oct. 1 , 1990 , and to $ 4.55 a year later .
Here are key provisions of the legislation Congress passed last year to increase the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour and establish a subminimum training wage for certain teen-age workers .
The minimum wage , $ 3.35 an hour since January 1981 , increases to $ 3.80 an hour on Sunday and to $ 4.25 an hour on April 1 , 1991 .
The training wage will be $ 3.35 an hour when the minimum wage rises to $ 3.80 an hour and $ 3.62 an hour when the minimum wage reaches $ 4.25 next April .
She added that the administration was also looking into raising the federal minimum wage - currently Dollars 4.25 an hour - but stressed that no decisions had been made .
David Card , of Princeton University , examined the effect of this increase in the federal minimum wage from Dollars 3.35 to Dollars 3.80 in 1990 .
The federal minimum wage was again increased in 1991 - from Dollars 3.80 to Dollars 4.25 .
In April 1992 , New Jersey increased its minimum wage from Dollars 4.25 to Dollars 5.05 , giving it the highest state minimum wage in the US .
Card and Kreuger surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants before and after the change both in New Jersey and in neighbouring eastern Pennsylvania where the minimum wage had stayed at Dollars 4.25 an hour .
This is the Congress which has refused for eight years to raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 .
The House , defying threats of a presidential veto , voted Thursday to raise the federal minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 by late 1991 , 30 cents higher than President Bush has said he would accept .
And in some states -- such as California , where the minimum is $ 4.25 -- state law already provides for a higher wage than federal law .
He wants the training wage to be today 's $ 3.35 -an-hour minimum .
The full minimum wage would rise to $ 3.85 an hour on Oct. 1 , $ 4.25 a year later and $ 4.55 in October of 1991 -- a year before Bush 's proposed $ 4.25 would go into effect .
California 's minimum wage is $ 4.25 .
Only a few million workers of the 99 million now in the work force actually earn the federal minimum wage , which is $ 3.35 an hour .

-LRB- On April 1 of this year , the federal minimum wage was increased to $ 3.80 .
Congress completed action Wednesday on a compromise bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour and sent it to the White House for President Bush 's promised signature .
The bill provides for the federal minimum wage to rise from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 3.80 next April 1 , then to $ 4.25 a year later .
California , which already has a $ 4.25 -an-hour minimum wage , would not be affected by the federal legislation .
Now she earns $ 4.25 an hour , the California minimum wage .
Minimum Wage : President Bush recently signed legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour by 1991 , but that move will not affect California , where the state-mandated minimum wage is already $ 4.25 per hour .
The increase in the minimum wage from $ 3.80 an hour is the second step of a two -part increase Congress enacted in 1989 after a long and fierce battle with the White House .
The first step of the increase took effect a year ago , when the minimum wage went from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 3.80 .
California already has a minimum wage of $ 4.25 , as do Connecticut , Rhode Island , Washington and Oregon . ;
The House Education and Labor Committee is considering a bill to raise the minimum wage to $ 5.05 an hour over the next four years from the current $ 3.35 .
Congress soon will consider an increase in the federal minimum wage to $ 5.05 from $ 3.35 an hour .
Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $ 3.35 , not one has a minimum at or above $ 5.05 .

The film was entirely different when presented to Williams by director Peter Weir .
Director Peter Weir takes a low-key approach , applying the same thoughtful style of last year 's `` Dead Poets Society , '' offering quiet shots of MacDowell watching the rain and presenting a Manhattan so golden you 'd think the lens was dipped in corn oil .
Peter Weir can be an maddening director .
Peter Weir -LRB- `` Mosquito Coast `` -RRB- directs .
And , as written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir , it is a first-rate film .
Enough members also remembered `` Dead Poets Society `` and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' two early summer releases , to put their directors -- Peter Weir and Rob Reiner -- on a list that also included previous DGA winners Woody Allen -LRB- `` Crimes and Misdemeanors '' -RRB- and Oliver Stone -LRB- `` Born on the Fourth of July '' -RRB- .
Peter Weir produces , directs and writes this romantic comedy starring Gerard Depardieu and `` sex , lies , and videotape 's '' Andie MacDowell .
Other pictures bound to get a lot of attention are : `` Steel Magnolias , '' the Herbert Ross -directed adaptation of the hit off-Broadway play set in a Southern beauty salon ; `` Born on the 4th of July `` -LRB- Universal -RRB- , Oliver Stone 's profile of paraplegic Vietnam hero Ron Kovic ; `` Letters '' -LRB- MGM/UA -RRB- , a relationship movie that teams Jane Fonda with Robert De Niro and reteams director Marty Ritt with his `` Norma Rae `` writers Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank , Jr. -RRB- ; `` Family Business `` -LRB- Tri-Star -RRB- , a three - generation family drama starring Sean Connery , Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick and directed by Sidney Lumet ; `` Always , '' another `` serious '' Steven Spielberg movie , this one starring Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter ; and `` Dead Poet 's Society `` -LRB- Touchstone -RRB- , which stars Robin Williams as a popular teacher in a boy 's prep school and directed by the gifted Australian Peter Weir .
Directed by Peter Weir , the funny and moving film shows -- as did `` Stand and Deliver `` -- how much difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring .
Even though Leonard is thoroughly American , Australian Peter Weir , who directed the film , saw something of the theatrically trained British actor in Leonard .
It involved a number of stars , including De Niro and -LRB- Al -RRB- Pacino , -LRB- directors -RRB- Rob Reiner , John Avildsen , Peter Weir , Jim Brooks , '' among others .
It is `` The Green Card , '' which director Peter Weir -LRB- `` Dead Poets Society `` -RRB- wrote especially for Depardieu .
He was drawn to `` Green Card `` because of its simplicity and because it had been tailor-designed for him -LRB- by director - writer Peter Weir of `` Dead Poets Society `` -RRB- .
Before rushing to clap Hollywood on the back , we should also add that `` Green Card `` stars the great French actor Gerard Depardieu and was directed by Australia 's Peter Weir , best known for `` Dead Poets Society `` and `` Witness `` -LRB- remember Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis cheek-to-cheeking to Sam Cooke 's `` Wonderful World `` -RRB- .
It , like this movie , is a reminder that we 'll buy just about anything , provided it 's delivered with charm and energy. ; Green Card ; -LRB- star -RRB- -LRB- star -RRB- -LRB- star -RRB- ; Rated : PG- 13 -LRB- slight profanity -RRB- ; Cast : Gerard Depardieu , Andie MacDowell ; Director - writer : Peter Weir
The feature film directed by Peter Weir placed 17th . ; Rounding out the top 10 was NBC 's `` A Different World `` at No. 5 , followed by the network 's `` Golden Girls . '' ;
Directed , scripted by Australia 's Peter Weir .
Hanks joins a long list of departing heavy-hitting actors , directors and producers -- Julia Roberts , Christopher Walken , Anjelica Huston , Costa-Gavras , Norman Jewison , Alan Pakula , Tim Robbins , Andie MacDowell , Renny Harlin , Peter Weir .
`` He 's a city -state , what a friend refers to as singular artists working within the mainstream , '' says Peter Weir , who directed Williams in `` Dead Poets Society . ''
`` It 's outside most people 's experience , '' concedes Peter Weir , who wrote , produced and directed `` Green Card . ''
It is n't yet clear whether his clients , including actor Gerald Depardieu and director Peter Weir , will follow .

Evelyn Hagopian , who was 3 years old when the Great Earthquake and Fire struck San Francisco 82 years ago today , has no plans to attend a gathering of the disaster 's shrinking number of survivors .
The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , which occurred before the Richter scale was devised , has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale .
The building is assumed to have burned or exploded in one of a half-dozen fires that devastated San Francisco between 1849 and 1851 , collapsing onto itself .
April 18 is the anniversary of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , which triggered fires which destroyed most of the city .
After the ceremonial tie was removed _ it burned in the San Francisco fire of 1906 _ historians believe an unknown Chinese worker probably drove the last steel spike into a wooden tie .
On the morning of April 18 , 1906 , the people of San Francisco woke abruptly to face calamity _ a devasting earthquake bringing widespread devastation and fire that killed at least 2,500 , and possibly 5,000 people .
SAN FRANCISCO , April 18 _ Earthquakes and fire today have put nearly half of San Francisco in ruins .
The devastating earthquake that killed hundreds in northern California vividly recalls the catastrophic quake and fire that laid waste to San Francisco in 1906 .
Tuesday 's devastating quake still is well short of the 1906 San Francisco quake , however , which was estimated at 8.3 on the scale .
The 1906 San Francisco quake was the largest American death toll , although at least two other events were stronger in terms of the Richter scale .
The 1906 earthquake and fire in San Francisco cost as much as $ 5.8 billion in current dollars , according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America .
The 1906 earthquake and fire in San Francisco cost as much as $ 5.8 billion in current dollars .

April 18 is the anniversary of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , which triggered fires that destroyed most of the city .
A sea captain called it the `` mad moment '' on that morning of April 18 , 1906 , when something mysteriously jolted his steamer in calm waters off San Francisco .
The startling photographs of this devastation assembled by Eric Saul and Don Denevi for their book `` The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire , 1906 `` show parts of the city looking like Hiroshima would look 39 years later when the atomic bomb was dropped .
But it was on this former landfill -- built after the 1906 quake as a testament to one city 's gutsy determination to endure and prevail -- that last week 's quake did its worst damage in San Francisco .
In San Francisco this was the closest that the latest quake came to the madness of 1906 .
It has suddenly become modern San Francisco 's reminder of the Great Earthquake of 1906 .
The 1906 San Francisco fire is believed to be the costliest blaze in state history , resulting in about $ 4 billion in claims -LRB- in 1988 dollars -RRB- , Krauss said. ;
The worst was from the huge fire that followed the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , when an estimated $ 5 billion in damage occurred. ;
But Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris ' office said total damage -- believed to be a loose estimate of all costs -- could well exceed $ 5 billion , rivaling the damage from the fire spawned by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as the nation 's costliest. ;
Disasters prior to 1949 , such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire , and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , would probably have cost more in today 's dollars .

Every year , the world adds a nation the size of Mexico to the population _ about 80 million people _ with nearly all the growth occurring in developing countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America that are least able to absorb it , the report says .
POPULATION _ Mexico has 80 million people , 20 million of whom live in the Mexico City metropolitan area .
Although the church claims 90 percent of Mexico 's 85 million people are Catholic , church figures show the number of Protestants grew more than 500 percent between 1950 and 1980 , to 3.29 percent of the population .
Meanwhile , in Mexico , where the population totals 80 million , the salary of a blue-collar worker is one-eighth that of a U.S. worker 's .
By the same token , our free trade agreement with Mexico means that Costa Rica is entering a country with a population of 90 million citizens , a country with a growing economy , a country that will become part of the First World at the beginning of the 21st century through the free trade agreement .
He then stressed the advantage of investing in Mexico , saying , `` Mexico 's population is 85 million people , and its market is the 10th largest in the world . ''
John Paul spent three hours in Chihuahua , enough time for 600 new babies to be born in Mexico where the population , now around 83 million , has grown by about 16 million since the Pope 's first Mexican visit in 1979 .

Since the union won the right to free agency in the mid-1970s , the average player 's salary has risen from just over Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 1.2m -LRB- Pounds 770,000 -RRB- .

The average salary for a player is Dollars 1.2m -LRB- Pounds 770,000 -RRB- a year .

The average baseball salary last season increased 19.8 % to $ 586,816 , according to a study by management 's Player Relations Committee .
The question to answer over the next few years -- assuming a continuing salary spiral that could produce an average player salary of $ 1 million , from the current $ 597,000 -- is this : Would a team 's bankruptcy make a dent in the skyrocketing salaries ?
According to figures compiled by the New York Times from contract data obtained from management and player sources , the average opening-day major league salary for all players -LRB- 708 total -RRB- is $ 890,844 , an astonishing 53 percent more than last year 's opening-day average. ;
According to this book , the average major-league baseball player makes more than $ 5,800 a week , and 50 of them collect checks of $ 20,000 a week or more .
After baseball owners opened up the market and bid feverishly for players , the average salary boomed to $ 412,520 from $ 51,501 in 1976 .
At a time when the average Major League player 's salary exceeds $ 800,000 , and baseball fans discuss paychecks as readily as prospects , no team rattled the teller 's cage louder than the Pirates in the time twixt the seasons .

The 87 people who died in a social club fire were martyrs to the quest for a better life , just like 146 people killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment factory , Mayor David Dinkins said Monday . Dinkins told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims of the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. that both tragedies killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in America .
`` In fact , that very day in 1911 , their boss went out late in the afternoon and locked all the workers of the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. inside , just to make sure none of them tried to leave early while he did some shopping , '' he said .

That would please Winnie the Pooh , that bear of little brain who signs off the pamphlet : `` Long words bother me. ''
`` Well , he 's about as close to Ronald Reagan on defense as Winnie the Pooh is to Refrigerator Perry in the area of bears . '' Bush was referring in the latter instance to William Perry , the more than 330-pound offensive lineman for the Chicago Bears football team .
A Canadian town that claims to be the birthplace of Winnie the Pooh wants to erect a giant statue of the famous bear , but Walt Disney studios will not permit it .
Instead , Disney suggested that White River put up a statue of a regular black bear and a plaque explaining the connection to Winnie the Pooh .
Many of their old bears are rare , including the celebrity bear , Aloysius , a patched-up 1907 Steiff featured in the British TV miniseries `` Brideshead Revisited , '' and a bear identical to the original Winnie the Pooh bought at Harrod 's in London for Christopher Robin , son of Pooh author A.A .
Walt Disney Co. has changed its mind and decided to allow a giant statue of Winnie the Pooh to be built in the Canadian town near where the famous little bear was born .
`` Once they verified the claim that Winnie the Pooh was a real bear and our story was accurate , their lawyers said we could go ahead and put up our statue . ''
`` We ca n't seem to convince the public that , although small , these animals are not Yogi Bear or Winnie the Pooh .

NutraSweet , a subsidiary of St. Louis -based Monsanto Co. , also developed aspartame , the artificial sweetener marketed under the name NutraSweet .
The sweetener , sucralose , which the company has been testing for several years , eventually might compete against aspartame , the highly successful product sold by Monsanto Co. under the brand name NutraSweet .
Two Boston researchers reported at a scientific conference here that aspartame , the generic name for the artificial sweetener NutraSweet , promoted seizures in a study of mice predisposed to seizures .
A human experiment at Duke University found that NutraSweet , the Monsanto Co. brand name for aspartame sweetener , was n't any more likely to cause headaches in people than a placebo .
Aspartame , which is marketed under the NutraSweet brand name , currently is used in powdered soft drinks and tea , milk -based drinks , toppings and desserts , and over-the-counter medications .
Sales of aspartame , marketed under the name NutraSweet , grew 9.6 % to $ 228 million from $ 208 million .
But NutraSweet Co. , which sells U.S. market leader aspartame under the brand name of NutraSweet , quickly dismissed the new competition as having an aftertaste .
Diet Coke is one of the biggest customers for aspartame , which is marketed under the name NutraSweet .
After that , competitors will be free to produce rival versions of aspartame , which NutraSweet sells under the NutraSweet brand name .

Iparretarrak , which means `` Those of the North '' in the Basque language , is fighting for independence for the Basque country in southwestern France and northern Spain .
It said the resumption of talks between the government and ETA leaders living in exile in Algeria might bring an end to 20 years of violence that has convulsed the three Basque provinces in northern Spain and spilled over into the rest of the country .
The alleged commando unit is said to have trained in the hills of France 's Basque country , in southwestern France .
The group seeks independence for the three - province Basque country of northeastern Spain .
Basque Nationalist Party -LRB- PNV -RRB- Chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated in a speech delivered during the Aberri Eguna -LSB- Basque Fatherland Day -RSB- celebrations that his party will not confine its political demands to the autonomy statute , that the PNV claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories , and that the Basque Country will `` gradually '' achieve a `` cultural , economic , and ultimately political unity in Europe , '' as well as asserting that the Constitution entrusts the defense of Spain 's unity to the Army and violence .
Nicolas Redondo Terreros , secretary general of the PSE of Vizcaya , said that Arzalluz ' remarks are `` intolerable '' and show `` separatism , '' although he specified that the problem is not between the Basque Country and the rest of Spain `` but among the Basques themselves , because there are many of us Basques who do not share Mr. Arzalluz ' idea of the Basque Country and Spain at all . ''
Nearly 23 years after beginning a terrorist war to 'free ' the Basque country from Spain , it killed its 700th Spaniard in Madrid .
Sensibly , the government has done no such thing , though it is always alert to any cracks it might exploit in the wall of separatist fanaticism it finds among ETA prisoners , the operating leadership which hides in France , and the spread of support organisations in the Basque country , including the political party , Herri Batasuna .
Many of its political and trade union leaders , drawn from the Basque country , genuinely believed that under enlightened liberal rule from Madrid , Basque separatist terrorism would wither and die .
It is time Spain 's friends and neighbours began to speak to those voters before the Basque country becomes a European problem closer to the heart of the continent than Northern Ireland .
PLANS to build a giant new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , the industrially blighted centre of commerce in Spain 's Basque country , have led to a revolt against the local government by some of the region 's most famous artists , including two renowned sculptors , Jorge Oteiza and Eduardo Chillida .

Nearly 1,000 steelworkers who have walked from northern Spain in protest at plans to cut 9,700 jobs and 1.5m tonnes of capacity from the state 's two integrated steelmakers in Asturias and the Basque country arrived in Madrid .
The Socialists are strong in the Basque country , too , but , even more important , might require the support in parliament in Madrid of the ruling Basque party if , as seems likely , Mr Gonzalez 's PSOE does not win a majority at the next general election .
Tucked into the Pyrenees in the heart of the Basque country near the Spanish border , the 170 hectares of mountainous vineyards is claimed to be the smallest appellation controlee district in France .
The Basque Country has some of the worst slums and some of the most unspoilt , richly forested valleys in western Europe .
Blessed with excellent communications , the best cuisine in Spain and , in San Sebastian , arguably the finest seaside resort city in Europe , the Basque Country has much to gain from opening itself out to others , not least to foreign tourists .
The Basque Country 's arrival at a cross- roads is timely in as much as Spain itself , on the political and economic level , faces a watershed of its own .
The planned overhaul of labour market rigidities by the Madrid government meanwhile appears tailor-made for the Basque Country 's recession-hit industry .
Current legislation , which applies to the Basque Country as it does everywhere else in Spain , is weighted towards fixed employment and makes dismissals costly .
But the Basque leader 's ideal is to have an enlarged Basque country , incorporating parts of south-west France and the adjoining Spanish province of Navarre , forming a Basque nation within the European Union .
Cheaper energy in France has prompted a leading steel company in Spain 's Basque country to cross the frontier and invest Pta11.2 bn
The latter were willing to subsidise up to 30 per cent of the investment if the plant remained in the Spanish Basque province of Guipuzcoa , alongside the French border , where the company has its headquarters and where four of its seven Spanish plants are located .
Spain 's high electricity prices have been consistently criticised by manufacturers based in the frontier zones of the Basque country and Catalonia which are barred from hooking up directly to the French grid by the government 's monopoly over the import of France 's nuclear-based energy .
One of the real joys of visiting Basque country is a sojourn to the villages in the Pyrenees foothills southeast of St. Jean .

Environmentalists say the Forest Service estimates are grossly inflated and even include trees that were destroyed by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens .
Inouye recalled Magnuson 's request for $ 950 million in state aid after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , `` a sum unheard of. ''
Those are Hurricane Hugo , with the cleanup still under way but costs expected to reach $ 3.98 billion ; Hurricane Agnes , 1972 , $ 3 billion ; Hurricane Camille , 1969 , $ 1.42 billion ; Hurricane Betsy , 1965 , $ 1.4 billion , and the eruption of Mount St. Helens , 1980 , $ 1.1 billion .
That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens .
`` It 's clear that the 1980 eruption was a sensation for the science of volcanology , '' said geologist Steve Brantley , stationed at the USGS Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver , Wash. , about 45 miles southwest of Mount St. Helens .
The May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens killed 57 people , devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the globe .
Scientists recounted the earthquake pattern before Mount St. Helens erupted May 18 , 1980 , with the fury of 2,500 Hiroshima bombs .
The process that forms Hawaii 's volcanoes is different from the one that forms volcanoes on the continental United States , such as Mount St. Helens , which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption in 1980 .
He also says he correctly predicted the 1971 earthquake in California 's San Fernando Valley , a deadly earthquake in Nicaragua in 1972 and eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980 .
The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth 's most powerful eruptions , a blast that spewed 600 times more material than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state .
The blast spewed 600 times more volcanic debris and ash than the May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state . ;
This theory comes to mind right now because it helps explain an event that happened just 11 years ago this week -- May 18 , 1980 -- the eruption of the Washington volcano known as Mount St. Helens. ; Historical value ; The volcanoes we studied in school were consigned , for the most part , to history classes , and , to be sure , there is a great deal of history to be learned from them .
He had been part of the team of scientists studying Mount St. Helens in Washington state during the months of volcanic activity before the big eruption on May 18 , 1980 , said Mike Fuller , chairman of the Geological Sciences department at UCSB . ; Glicken left an observatory on Mount St. Helens the day before the volcano blew , said Joan Magruder , a UCSB spokeswoman .
on the topic of Mount St. Helens in 1986 , Fuller said. ;
An American researcher , Harry Glicken , was among the missing , according to Joan Magruder , a spokeswoman for the University of California , Santa Barbara , where Glicken was an assistant researcher in geological sciences. ; Glicken , who worked for the U.S. Geological Survey until 1989 , narrowly escaped death in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state .
Glicken , who was working with the Tokyo Metropolitan University , reportedly escaped death in 1980 when he fled the Mount St. Helens eruption at the last moment .
Pinatubo 's last eruption , 600 years ago , is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980 .
They did n't know it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base . ;
In contrast , the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington was barely a 5 , said Dallas Peck , a volcanologist and director of USGS . ;

Ideally , there are two routes companies can take when moving into advanced market countries -LRB- i.e. , North America and Europe -RRB- : they can either set up their own production bases there through foreign direct investments -LRB- local production -RRB- or they can base their production on tie-ups with -LSB- local -RSB- enterprises -LRB- establish mutually complementary production relationships , OEM -LSB- original equipment manufacturer -RSB- tie-ups , technical tie-ups , or joint development -RRB- .

In the past year it has struck oem -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- deals with Wang of the US for personal computers and mid-range machines and with Siemens of Germany for memory chips .
This would represent a move away from OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- products towards higher added value products , possibly branded .
Matsushita , the world 's largest consumer electronics company , is launching a high-definition laser disc player which it is procuring from rival Sony in its first Original Equipment Manufacturer -LRB- OEM -RRB- agreement .
Until recently , both Kia and Daewoo have largely relied on supplying cars to other companies on an OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- basis for most of their exports .
As they shift the focus of their own energies to high value-added products , Japanese companies are looking increasingly to tie-ups and OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- deals with other companies , to supply them with those products that are less profitable for them to produce but which they still need to complement their product line-up .
Winkler says downward pressure on prices is much more intense than a year ago , particularly for manufacturers who are large OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- suppliers .
But Sharp 's sales to computer makers , known as original equipment manufacturer , or OEM , sales , in the United States last year were `` negligible '' when compared to the $ 1.5 billion logged by its U.S. consumer electronics unit in New Jersey , according to Peel .

Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos will lead a delegation representing President Bush at Sunday 's inauguration of Jamie Poz Zamora as president of Bolivia , the White House announced Thursday .
Jaime Paz Zamora , the third-place finisher in May elections , was elected president of Bolivia following an all-night debate in Congress , officials said today .
In a telephone interview with The Associated Press after the congressional vote , Paz Zamora said , `` I wish to express my profound gratitude to the Bolivian people who , abiding by the constitution , have expressed their will electing me president of Bolivia . ''
Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco said President Alan Garcia had confirmed the meeting with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and Bolivia 's president , Jaime Paz Zamora .
Garcia , Barco and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia met here Tuesday before the beginning of the Group of Eight gathering and agreed to invite Bush to a drug summit , to be held within three months in a Latin American nation .
Bolivia : Former President Victor Paz Estenssoro brought 24,000 percent annual inflation down to 16 percent in 1989 by freeing prices and the exchange rate , closing money-losing government tin mines and reducing a bloated bureacracy .
`` I have the feeling we are writing one of the most beautiful and clean pages in the contemporary history of Bolivia , '' President Jaime Paz Zamora said Monday night during a meeting with leaders of Bolivia 's lowland Indian community .
The group takes its name from the late brother of Bolivia 's current president , Jaime Paz Zamora .
President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia is host of the summit , attended by presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia , Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela , Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador .
The Chilean Government has indicated that it is fully prepared to begin a `` new era '' of relations with Bolivia by evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 's most recent remarks about not tying any future step toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning of talks on Bolivia 's lack of a sea outlet .
My second question is : Please expand your comment that following the visit to Chile of Ximena Sanchez de Lozada -LSB- the Bolivian president 's wife -RSB- there will be talks on Bolivia 's landlocked situation .
I want to paraphrase what President Sanchez de Lozada said when he visited Chile : We will help Bolivia join the world .
In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina , Bolivia , and Paraguay , and decided to invite Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually beneficial development projects .
President Sanchez de Lozada expressed by phone his complete satisfaction with the result of his visit to Argentina because the No. 1 issue , the sale of natural gas to Argentina , was excellent for Bolivia after difficult negotiations .
During his stay in Bolivia , Gore will meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other national authorities , under strict security measures .
President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an observer and in his speech he stressed his country 's interest in Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia has signed .
Prior to that , on the occasion of the soccer World Cup opening match between Germany and Bolivia in Chicago , Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada wants to discuss Latin America 's future relations with the United States and the European Union -LSB- EU -RSB- with Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton .
Four years ago Bolivia was represented by Jaime Paz Zamora , who was president at that time .
-LSB- Sanchez recording ends abruptly -RSB- -LSB- Reporter -RSB- The foreign media asked President Sanchez if a sea outlet was the only way for Bolivia to integrate itself into a modern economy .
The metaphor about the `` milk and the cow `` was thoroughly explained today by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , when he said that even if Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic , with the full use of the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay .
The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other `` outlets `` to the Pacific and Atlantic , and these would be the port of Ilo in Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway , because Bolivia is entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which it is necessary to seek ports for exports .
La Paz , 27 Apr -LRB- EFE -RRB- -- Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the risk of becoming the target of `` narcoguerrilla '' actions .
La Paz , 27 Apr -LRB- EFE -RRB- -- Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the risk of becoming the target of `` narco-guerrilla '' actions .
Mr Jaime Paz Zamora , the Bolivian president said recently : 'I am convinced that the coca leaf has a legal use , and should not be under 'house arrest ' by being restricted to Bolivia ' .
BOLIVIA is to supply Brazil with natural gas from the start of 1995 , under a preliminary agreement signed by President Fernando Collor of Brazil and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia , Christopher Philipsborn reports from La Paz .
PRESIDENTIAL campaigning is hotting up ahead of a June election in Bolivia , as the four-year term of President Jaime Paz Zamora draws to its close .
MR Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , a US -raised mine company owner , looks set to be the new president of Bolivia , after the most peaceful elections in the country 's history , held on Sunday .
To the president of Bolivia , Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , it seems simple .
However , President Sanchez de Lozada this week arrived in Brazil saying Bolivia wanted a 49 per cent stake in the pipeline , instead of the 4 per cent Petrobras allegedly offered .
President Sanchez de Lozada said last night that Bolivia wanted 49 per cent and that the project was a 'parity relationship ' .
Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself , two of Bolivia 's most far-sighted men are entrepreneurs who , after spending many years outside their native land , have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into reality .
President Bush today assured Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora that `` you and your countrymen will not stand alone '' in fighting cocaine and trying to improve Bolivia 's ailing economy .
Outgoing President Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia , the fifth member of the Andean Pact , sent his foreign minister to the meeting .
Jaime Paz Zamora , the new president of Bolivia , says his administration will do its part in the fight against cocaine traffic as long as the cost is not an undue burden on this impoverished country .
The White House disclosure came as Bush met with Bolivia 's President Paz Zamora and said La Paz `` wo n't stand alone '' in fighting cocaine and in trying to improve the nation 's economy .

DeBeers ' mines in South Africa , Botswana and Namimbia account for 36 percent of world production , and 17 percent of the value of the sales of the selling organization come from diamonds mined in South Africa , the GAO report noted .
Most of Angola 's diamonds are currently mined from alluvial operations in Lunda Norte , chiefly the Cuango division .
It also became clear yesterday that De Beers faces competition from Japan in Yakutia , where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes to help set up a cutting centre .
It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in Yakutia , where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes to help set up a cutting centre .
After the break-up of the Soviet Union the contract was continued with Rosalmazzoloto , the Russian gold and diamond organisation , and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with Yukutia , the area in eastern Siberia where most Russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation .
Reports suggest that the diamond centre would have exclusive rights to buy all rough diamonds mined in the Russian Federation and it would also have a monopoly of sorting gem diamonds .
Diamonds were mined in India for hundreds of years before they were discovered in South Africa .

Scientists who were once smuggled into this town from all over the country as part of the Manhattan Project 's secret attempt to build an atomic bomb in the 1940s returned openly for a reunion this week .
The effort was an arm of the Manhattan Project , the code name for America 's effort to build atomic weapons before Nazi Germany did during World War II .
This was the Manhattan Project , the effort that created the world 's first atomic bomb .
He also played a significant role in developing the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project , invented several types of atom smashers and did a personal analysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy .
Alvarez also played a significant role in developing the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project , invented several types of atom smashers and did a personal analysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy .
Another fact-based historical movie is `` Day One , '' about the Manhattan Project and the race to build an atomic bomb .
Certainly , a movie about the development of the A- bomb , the Manhattan Project as it was called , sounded like it had a lot of potential _ the race against time , the dangerous testing , and most importantly , the deep moral questions about developing so destructive a weapon .
Hanford was established late in World War II as part of the Manhattan Project to build atomic bombs .
The secrecy dates from the Manhattan Project , during which scientists built the atom bomb that devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two .
In the course of his long career , Weisskopf worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during World War II , which produced the atomic bomb and which impressed the twin themes of science for good and science for evil onto his thought .
Ever since the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb in World War II , the Pentagon normally has shared details about the nature and cost of super- secret programs with a few senior members of Congress ' defense and appropriations committees . ; Congressional leaders are trying this year to seize control of the Pentagon 's $ 35 billion `` black budget '' for secret military and intelligence programs .
In 1946 British physicists , back home after being major participants in the Allies ' Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb , gathered at a former air base here to plan Britain 's entry into the atomic age .

In a one-paragraph statement , her press office said : `` At Bethesda Naval Hospital on Feb. 14 , Mrs. Bush underwent a routine outpatient medical procedure to remove a small basal cell carcinoma , a common form of skin cancer , from her upper lip .
There are several different types of skin cancer , but the most common ones are basal cell carcinoma , which is the most common ; squamous cell carcinoma ; and malignant melanoma .
That is one reason why basal-cell carcinomas , the most common skin cancer found in Caucasians , form primarily on sun-exposed areas of the body , such as the face and neck .
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is the second most common human cancer , the first being cancer of the skin 's next lower layer of cells , the basal cells .

According to real estate consultants Cushman & Wakefield , more than 640,000 white collar jobs were lost in the United States during the 1990-1991 recession and the continued consolidations and downsizings of major American firms promise that the talent pool will remain large .
More important than changes in basic rent levels in the past 18 months has been a steep fall in the concessions that landlords have had to offer to attract tenants , says Mr Josh Kuriloff , a director of Cushman & Wakefield , a New York real estate company .
About $ 84 million worth , or 20 % of the FDIC 's current real estate portfolio , will be sold today in a venture with the auctioneer Christie 's and the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield .

Brokers with high ambitions want to compete with the three biggest real estate companies , Cushman & Wakefield , Grubb & Ellis and Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services , each of which has more than 50 branches serving markets from Boston to Los Angeles .

`` Views are extremely valuable and are big selling points here , '' said John M. Cefaly , executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield Inc. , a commercial real estate brokerage concern based here .

The Great Depression went on for 43 months , starting in August 1929 and ending in March 1933 .
When Schumpeter analyzed the Great Depression of the 1930 's , he studied the capabilities of the then main industries , such as automobiles , steel , chemicals , etc. , and concluded that these industries were not in a particularly deplorable state and , to explain why such a serious depression resulted despite that , he turned his attention to the overall stage setting of industrial operations .
The organizational principle of the New Deal , which triggered the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930 's , was to `` involve '' various organizations in its operations .
Will the present recession repeat some of the trends of the great Depression of the early 1930s ?
There is no resemblance between this and the Great Depression : between 1929 and 1933 US real gross national product fell by 30 per cent , while German GDP declined by 24 per cent between 1929 and 1932 .
This period was in the UK from 1873 to 1896 and was indeed once known as 'the great depression ' .
The title of a historical booklet , Professor S B Saul 's The Myth of the Great Depression , 1873-1896 -LRB- Macmillan 1989 -RRB- , tells its own story .
That did not prevent the Great Depression of 1929-1933 and the accompanying collapse of stable exchange rates .

Several former Green Berets on contract to the U.S. government for anti-narcotics efforts in Peru designed the Santa Lucia base , which includes an airstrip big enough for C-130s , three helicopter pads and nine buildings ringed by barbed wire and mines .
`` Santa Lucia is probably better fortified than most military bases in Peru , '' said Craig Chretien , the Drug Enforcement Administration chief in Peru .
Monday 's raid was witnessed by the first reporters allowed onto a new U.S. -built anti-narcotics base in Santa Lucia since it began operating Sept. 8 beside the Huallaga River in the heart of Peru 's coca -producing region .
The heavily fortified garrison in Santa Lucia is the centerpiece of the U.S. government 's increasingly militarized campaign against the drug trade in Peru , which produces nearly 70 percent of the world 's coca leaf , the source of cocaine .
U.S. drug agents have been carrying out operations since September with Peruvian police from a U.S. -built base at Santa Lucia in the Huallaga Valley .
It 's about the oldest part of Italy 's Naples , the Santa Lucia quarter which was named after the saint .
A high-ranking officer at the Santa Lucia police base has reported that a group of peasant patrols located in Peru 's coca -producing regions is offering protection to drug traffickers operating in these areas , in exchange for large sums of money .
The British -LRB- Tour World -RRB- company will begin operations in Cuba in early May at Santa Lucia Beach on the northern coast of Camaguey .
The British tourists will join those who prefer the attractions of Santa Lucia beach , the bulk of whom come from Germany , Canada , The Netherlands , and Italy .
Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 14 April reports that the British tourist operation company Sun World will tender its letter of credentials in Cuba to begin operations on the Santa Lucia beach in Camaguey Province .
This month the US Drugs Enforcement Agency said it would probably have to cease operations out of the Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga valley , Peru 's main coca -growing area .
The Santa Lucia base - which costs an annual Dollars 13m - seems to have succeeded in reducing trafficking out of the Huallaga Valley - only to move it to more remote areas .

Copies of the video , in VHS or Beta format , can be ordered for $ 9 plus $ 2.75 for mailing and handling from Commonwealth Films , 1500 Brook Road , Richmond , Va .
JVC originated the VHS video format , while Sony is a strong backer of 8-millimeter video .
RCA- Columbia will release the video in VHS and Beta format at a suggested retail price of $ 89.95 .
As demonstrated in the 1980s by the competition between the two rival video systems - VHS and Betamax - the success of a new format depends crucially on how much software is available to be played on it .
The company has been attempting to allay fears that this fight - which it could lose to Matsushita , as it did with its Betamax video format versus its rival 's VHS - is inhibiting investment in other potentially promising directions .
For those would-be cinematographers with 8mm camcorders , the Korean electronics company Goldstar has introduced a simpler way of transferring recordings from 8mm to VHS format so that the film can be viewed like an ordinary video .
Sony had led the way with its technically superior Betamax format but eventually - in what was an expensive failure - had to concede defeat to JVC , which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers to use its VHS standard .
The rivalry raises the threat of a repetition of the 'video war ' in the 1980s when Sony lost a battle to impose Betamax as the standard format for video cassettes against the VHS format devised by the Matsushita group .
The 8-millimeter video format is smaller than the more established VHS format , and it is starting to take hold , particularly for camcorders and the new portable devices like the one Wayman is toting .
However , continuing strength of the VHS video format and the introduction of VHS -C , a popular compact system backed by such major companies as General Electric Co. 's RCA Corp. unit and Zenith Electronics Corp. , have slowed the momentum of 8-mm .
When Sony fired the next salvo , its 8mm video camera , JVC was close behind with a competing product that uses VHS -C format tapes , which do n't fit in Sony 's machines .
Sony is now pushing its compact 8mm tapes as a better format than VHS for personal video recording .

The mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as Mount St. Helens ' May 18 , 1980 , explosion .
Several witnesses during the retrial testified that Brigham claimed to be a writer and said cosmic voices warned him of such disasters as the eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980 , which left 57 people dead or missing .
Today 's highlight in history : On May 18 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington state .
Inouye recalled Magnuson 's request for $ 950 million in state aid after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , `` a sum unheard of. ''
Those are Hurricane Hugo , with the cleanup still under way but costs expected to reach $ 3.98 billion ; Hurricane Agnes , 1972 , $ 3 billion ; Hurricane Camille , 1969 , $ 1.42 billion ; Hurricane Betsy , 1965 , $ 1.4 billion , and the eruption of Mount St. Helens , 1980 , $ 1.1 billion .
That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens .
Mount St. Helens erupted May 18 , 1980 , leveling 230 square miles , leaving 57 people dead or missing and creating an ash cloud that circled the globe .
Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument , a 110 , 000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural regeneration , the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall .
The May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens killed 57 people , devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the globe .

The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth 's most powerful eruptions , a blast that spewed 600 times more material than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state .
The blast spewed 600 times more volcanic debris and ash than the May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state . ;
He had been part of the team of scientists studying Mount St. Helens in Washington state during the months of volcanic activity before the big eruption on May 18 , 1980 , said Mike Fuller , chairman of the Geological Sciences department at UCSB . ; Glicken left an observatory on Mount St. Helens the day before the volcano blew , said Joan Magruder , a UCSB spokeswoman .
on the topic of Mount St. Helens in 1986 , Fuller said. ;
Glicken , who was working with the Tokyo Metropolitan University , reportedly escaped death in 1980 when he fled the Mount St. Helens eruption at the last moment .
Pinatubo 's last eruption , 600 years ago , is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980 .
They did n't know it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base . ;
In contrast , the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington was barely a 5 , said Dallas Peck , a volcanologist and director of USGS . ;
`` A veritable morel garden '' was reported after Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980 , according to the book `` A Morel Hunter 's Companion . ''
`` We ca n't be assured that there wo n't be more major eruptive activity , '' says Ed Wolfe , chief scientist at the Cascades Volcano Observatory , established in Vancouver , Wash. , after the 1980 explosion of Mount St. Helens .

In the past year it has struck oem -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- deals with Wang of the US for personal computers and mid-range machines and with Siemens of Germany for memory chips .
This would represent a move away from OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- products towards higher added value products , possibly branded .
Matsushita , the world 's largest consumer electronics company , is launching a high-definition laser disc player which it is procuring from rival Sony in its first Original Equipment Manufacturer -LRB- OEM -RRB- agreement .
Until recently , both Kia and Daewoo have largely relied on supplying cars to other companies on an OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- basis for most of their exports .
As they shift the focus of their own energies to high value-added products , Japanese companies are looking increasingly to tie-ups and OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- deals with other companies , to supply them with those products that are less profitable for them to produce but which they still need to complement their product line-up .
Winkler says downward pressure on prices is much more intense than a year ago , particularly for manufacturers who are large OEM -LRB- original equipment manufacturer -RRB- suppliers .
But Sharp 's sales to computer makers , known as original equipment manufacturer , or OEM , sales , in the United States last year were `` negligible '' when compared to the $ 1.5 billion logged by its U.S. consumer electronics unit in New Jersey , according to Peel .

Mount Rushmore is the great public magnet of the Black Hills .
Too bad , for Mount Rushmore is just an added attraction ; the main show is the Black Hills region itself , an area that was beautifully photographed in the Oscar- nominated epic , `` Dances With Wolves . '' ;
Then I turned and saw a character right out of Western fiction : the last of the old Black Hills prospectors , Potato Creek Johnny in the flesh -- a gnarled , bearded , ragged gnome of a man , no taller than I was , complete with burro and gold pans and happy to tell a 14-year-old kid about the half-pound nugget he found back in the glory days. ; Potato Creek Johnny joined Wild Bill and Calamity years ago in the Mount Moriah Cemetery .

''
I keep meaning to see such places , but always seem to get hung up somewhere in the Badlands or the breaks of French Creek , or in the 1.2 million acres of the Black Hills National Forest .
The things that draw me to the Black Hills and stay in my mind have little to do with Mount Rushmore and the main tourist centers . ;
Another source is the Black Hills , Badlands and Lakes Association , 900 Jackson Blvd. , Rapid City , S.D .
Deadwood 's 80 or so gaming parlors are concentrated in a four -block section of Main Street , with a few souvenir shops featuring the distinctive pink-tinged Black Hills gold jewelry sandwiched in between. ;
The poker hand Hickok held -- two black aces , two black eights and the nine of diamonds -- is still known as the Dead Man 's Hand. ; Deadwood has a history unmatched by many places in the Midwest or elsewhere. ; Gen. George Custer of Little Big Horn notoriety set off the rush to Deadwood when he confirmed in 1874 that there was gold in the hills .
Only Mount Rushmore , deep in the Black Hills , would remain in federal hands .

Mr. American Horse has made pilgrimages to Bear Butte , a stark volcanic outcrop near the Black Hills ' northern perimeter where Indian worshipers have tied hundreds of brightly colored prayer cloths in the trees as tributes to ancestors .
Watson Parker , another Black Hills historian , says some of the Sioux 's traditional stories were made up by local residents for tourist brochures , written to lure visitors during the 1920s and 1930s .
Congress 's revision took back more than seven million acres from the Sioux , including the Black Hills and the site of the Homestake Mine , the richest gold lode ever discovered in the U.S. and still an operating mine .
Prickly relations between Indians and whites go back at least to 1874 , when Col. George Armstrong Custer , the flamboyant Indian fighter , infuriated the Sioux by parading a party of U.S. cavalry-complete with brass band -- on a gold hunt through the Black Hills .

Previous winners include former U.N. Secretary-General U Thant , U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. , missionary Mother Teresa , Dr. Jonas Salk who developed a polio vaccine , South African activist Nelson Mandela , Indian leader Indira Gandhi , and Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme .
A vaccine developed by polio pioneer Jonas Salk may help wipe out the AIDS virus in people already infected and stop them from getting the deadly disease , according to preliminary research presented Thursday .
Salk said that creating an AIDS vaccine is much more difficult than a polio vaccine , which he developed in the 1950s .
`` He was a pioneer in the field of polio , '' said Salk , who finally developed the breakthrough vaccine that virtually wiped out the crippling disease .
The prototype vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk , father of the commercial polio vaccine .
Salk developed the first polio vaccine , which was pronounced safe and effective on April 12 , 1955 .
In the 1960s , an oral polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Albert Sabin , and it has generally replaced the Salk vaccine , in part because of the ease of giving it .
The vaccine developed by Sabin is also more potent and long-lasting , but because it uses tamed live virus , one of about every 3.2 million doses results in paralytic polio , according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta .
Dr. Jonas Salk , who developed a vaccine for polio , also is testing an experimental vaccine made from inactivated AIDS viruses that are replicated and do n't contain anything that could be infectious .
The Food and Drug Administration approved today nationwide testing of a post- exposure AIDS vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk , who pioneered the polio vaccine .
This pattern of anxious summers and long falls , counting the cases-some crippled , some dead , some remarkably spared in spite of infection -- came to a dramatic end in the spring of 1955 when immunologist Tom Francis announced to the world that the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh safely and effectively prevented polio .
Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine , and later , Albert Sabin developed the oral version. ; `` Humanitarianism requires that we offer these gifts to all people of the world , regardless of race , color or creed .
Using a vaccine after infection was suggested four years ago by Dr. Jonas Salk , who developed the first polio vaccine .
Jonas -RRB- Salk -LRB- who developed a vaccine for polio -RRB- .
Jonas Salk , creator of the original polio vaccination , twice injected himself before beginning broad human trialsonce in 1942 with influenza vaccine and again in 1952 with polio vaccine .
Enders 's breakthrough also paved the way for one of the less edifying scientific feuds of this century , as Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed rival polio vaccines in the '50s .

China has estimated that to hold its population within the planned limit of 1.2 billion in 2000 and 1.5 billion in 2050 , it must keep the birth rate below 1.5 percent .
If that pace is maintained , China 's 1 billion people will become 2 billion by 2030 , according to a recent estimate by the U.N. Fund for Population Activities .
It found the proportion of children in China 's total population of 1.07 billion to be 28.68
If the trend continues , China 's population of 1.08 billion will double by the year 2030 , according to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities .
China has said that it must keep the birth rate at 1.5 percent if it is to meet its goal of keeping the population under 1.2 billion by the year 2000 .
Farmers , accounting for more than three-fourths of China 's population of 1 billion , and the growing number of private entrepreneurs often have no guaranteed source of income after retirement .
An official at the United Nations Fund for Population Activities said the move was unusual because China recently has taken steps to enforce its `` one family , one child '' policy .
Li said the policy change would not greatly affect China 's population growth because only 19 percent of China 's families have one child .
The report said 22.46 per million among China 's ethnic minority groups reach 100 , but the rate is only 2.5 for 1 million people among the Han , the group which makes up 94 percent of China 's 1 billion population .
China 's population has reached 1.1 billion , and officials said Friday that the nation 's population growth is out of control despite a government policy allowing only one child per family .
North Korea is helped in its task of control by a smaller population _ 20 million people to China 's 1.2 billion _ and strong non-ideological unifying forces : a sense of outside threat , from South Korea , and the common goal of national reunification .
But even at the current rate , the government 's planning commission predicted , India 's population will hit 1 billion by the turn of the century and rise to 1.7 billion by the year 2035 , probably surpassing China as the world 's most populous country .
Hong Kong 's economy and society have far greater influence on China 's 1 billion people than its comparatively small population would suggest .
China today released preliminary figures from its largest-ever census showing a population of 1.133 billion - 20 million more people than the government had planned .
`` For China to reach its goal of a population of 1.25 billion by the year 2000 ...
China has failed to stay within its population targets because of a baby boom and the government 's inability to maintain its one -child-per-family policy , especially in the countryside .
By the end of 1993 , China had a population of 1.18517 billion , which was 13.46 million more than in 1992 , the sources said .
The total population of China was 1.1851 billion at the end of the year .
According to statistics , China 's nearly 1.2 billion population grows by 15 million each year on average , while its cultivated land is shrinking at an average rate of 300,000 ha -LSB- hectares -RSB- each year .
The whole Chinese nation hopes to rapidly transform China into a prosperous land , free from poverty and backwardness , Jiang stresses in his speech , adding , `` We are an Asian country with 5,000 years of history and a population of 1.1 billion citizens .
Family planning has been one of China 's fundamental policies , its main purpose being the control of population growth .
Its large population is a unique characteristic of China , and one in which the various countries of the world have no actual experience .
The point that these people do not understand is that China has a population of 1.1 billion , and that this makes it quite different from Japan , Holland , Belgium , and the `` four little dragons . ''
China 's population , which is now 1.1 billion people , will increase by sheer inertia to at least 1.5 to 1.6 billion at its peak in the next century , according to forecasts accepted by the majority of experts .
The reason for China 's low per capita index is , first of all , the backwardness of its productive forces , or , one may say , the insufficiency of this numerator , while the excessively large population and the continuous population inflation in the denominator are elements that will undoubtedly prevent the per capita index from going up for a long time .
On the other hand , China 's per capita resources index , which is so very far behind the average world levels -LRB- arable land , forestry land , sweet water resources are only one-third , one - ninth , and one-quarter , respectively , of average world levels -RRB- will steadily deteriorate further because of the increases in population .
When family planning was first started in China in the 1970 's , the most effective argument in its propaganda was that China already had a very large base population figure , its population growth was rapid , and the age structure of its population was a youthful one .
Third , in China , family planning starts out from the realities of China , always regarding control of population volume and raising the quality of the population -LRB- this mainly refers to eugenic excellence and excellence in child raising -RRB- as one uniform entity , which is different from family planning abroad , where restriction of births is the one and only objective .
Moreover , with a population of 1.2 billion , China has an unlimited supply of labor .
With a total population of 1.16 billion , China is now the 28th poorest country in the world , according to the World Bank 's updated list .
About three per cent of China 's 1.2 billion population carry the new virus strain .
Contrasting this , there is a superabundant hope among its people in China that the 1.2 billion population will have a better future with improved living standards , do n't you think ?
it raises a vital concern for us to contemplate where we would be in the next few years with economic growth of only four percent per year compared to the 13 percent annual growth rate of China with a population of 1.2 billion .
But if true , it reflects the success of China 's population programme , one of the most ambitious and internationally controversial aspects of its policy .
Latest government figures put the total at 1.17bn : China now has a nearly quarter of the world 's population on around seven per cent of the world 's arable land .
There may be good business to be done in cellular telephones in Singapore -LRB- population 2.5m -RRB- , or nibbling at the edges of a liberalised telecoms market in Taiwan -LRB- population 21m -RRB- , but China -LRB- population 1.2bn -RRB- is where the future lies for Hongkong Telecom .
`` In China , with a population of 1.1 billion people , holding fast to our socialist position and successfully building socialism with Chinese characteristics will be our contributions to the communist cause , '' party chief Jiang Zemin said in a recent speech. ;
If this continues , China 's 1.08 billion population will swell to 1.5 billion by 2010 , straining anew the country 's efforts to modernize .
China 's population of 1.13 billion still carries the Confucian instinct of yielding to authority .
China 's population of more than one billion is expected to reach 1.16 billion this year , up 17 million from 1990 , and to surge a record 24 million next year , the lunar year of the monkey , which the China Daily said is believed to be auspicious for births .
For example , 40 % of China 's population of 1.15 billion is age 19 or younger .

Duke Ellington liked to compose tone poems , as well as short jazz tunes , and the American Composers Orchestra performed four of those longer work at Carnegie Hall in what was billed as the first all-Ellington symphonic concert .
Ellington undoubtedly had a detailed program in his head when he composed `` Harlem , '' and it 's fun to hear the melodies and decide when Duke had the populace partying or somebody feeling blue .

The Queen , on the first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch to Spain , only alluded to the British colony at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula .
Then , in 1492 Queen Isabella , in an effort to consolidate her position on the Iberian Peninsula , signed an edict banishing all Moslems and Jews from Spain .
Seafaring nations , Spain and Portugal traditionally have had little to do with each other , although they share the Iberian Peninsula , are n't divided by mountains or rivers , and do n't need passports to cross the border .
The first in a series of blows that would prove fatal to Jewish culture on the Iberian Peninsula was a series of pogroms in 1391 that whittled down Spain 's Jewish population by as much as a third , between deaths , exiles and conversions .
Nobody is claiming that the Iberian peninsula forms a trading bloc similar to that of Scandinavia , or that Portugal and Spain can be grouped together as are the Benelux countries .
Spain 's accession , in particular , gave such produce as citrus and tomatoes from the Iberian Peninsula much easier access to the markets of northern Europe .
Our national cultures coincide with the physical limits of each of our nations , even as our larger cultural boundaries embrace the Iberian peninsula -- Spain and Portugal -- and through them Europe ; and even as our internal diversification includes Indian and black cultures .
Also important is Portugal 's strategic contribution on the Iberian Peninsula at a time when Spain 's Socialist government plays neutralist and anti-U.S .

Iraqi authorities have said they will build a new drinking water processing plant in Basra that will tap water from the Euphrates River near Nasrriya , 75 miles north .
It is fed by the Euphrates River and Iraq 's southern marshes .
During the one-month stoppage , Syria and Iraq will get less water from the tributaries of the Euphrates , the river that has been the lifeblood throughout history for the area that once formed ancient Mesopotamia .
But the event is considered a cause for worry for Iraq and Syria , which are highly dependent on the waters of the 1 , 460-mile Euphrates River .
But Syria is in a position to divert more of the Euphrates River water to its own reservoirs and allow just a trickle to Iraq .

He also said his agency is working on converting city bus systems from diesel to natural gas or methane fuel , and perhaps will eliminate diesel buses in 10 to 12 years .
Methane is another such gas , and natural gas is almost all methane .
`` If we went in and found the leaks and fixed them in the natural gas systems in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , you 'd have a very large start at reducing the contribution of methane -LRB- natural gas -RRB- to global warming , '' Hogan said Wednesday by telephone from Washington .
About half of global warming is caused by carbon dioxide gas from fossil fuel burning , about 20 percent is due to chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , and an additional 20 percent is caused by methane , which is natural gas , Rowland said .
That means a 10 percent reduction in natural gas emissions worldwide would halt increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane and cancel its contribution to increased global warming , Rowland said .
To their delight , the mixture began producing traces of methane , the flammable ingredient of natural gas .
DURING THE FUEL shortage of the early 1970s , the natural gas industry , through its Gas Research Institute in Chicago , started supporting research into ways to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane .
Now , when there are plentiful supplies of methane or natural gas , the gas institute has switched to finding new uses and markets for methane while continuing to support on a modest scale basic research for turning carbon dioxide and water into methane .
Natural gas , which is 90 % to 95 % methane , is too plentiful and cheap .

But while some say ISDN is one of the most important developments in telecommunications since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone , sceptics say it is a solution looking for a problem and will take up to 10 years before it is accepted by the wider community , if ever .
Despite the presence of a conservative , deregulating government for the past 11 years , Canadian telephone companies have enjoyed nearly a monopoly in the provision of domestic and business telephone services , almost from the very moment Alexander Graham Bell , invented the telephone .
The opportunity for design lies in developing products , or 'content ' , to match the scale of the investments being made in the infrastructure : as much money will be spent on networks between now and 2000 as was spent on all telephone systems and equipment since Alexander Graham Bell invented them .
Brennan calls this intelligent network `` the major revolution in the telephone since Alexander Graham Bell invented it . ''
That 's when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone , and the Jew realized he could call a gentile to do the job '' -RRB- , and marriage is a prison sentence .
Bell , pleased as punch , says , `` Watson , I have just invented the telephone .
For example , when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 , it did not ring off the hook with calls from potential backers .
Mr. Inose , who invented the digital telephone switch as a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and Bell Telephone in the late 1950s , said : `` I have repeatedly told the government that the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- has spent a great deal to invite Japanese scientists and engineers on Fulbright scholarships .
Ericsson , which was founded in 1876 , the same year Alexander Graham Bell invented his telephone , began a big expansion outside Sweden in the early 20th century and in the past few years has made the most of an equipment-buying binge by Western European phone companies .

`` I think what is happening is really insulting to the voters of Wisconsin , '' said Garvey , who led the NFL players out on strike 1982 .
In 1987 , NFL players went on strike , mainly over the issue of free agency .
The NFL Management Council , which devised the plan , is optimistic it can convince Judge David Doty , who is presiding in the antitrust suit filed by the union after the 1987 strike , that there is freedom of movement for players .
The system is an outgrowth of that 24-day 1987 strike , which ended with an antitrust suit filed by the NFL Players Assn. , asking the courts to grant it the free agency it could n't get on the picket line .
But CBA stands for collective bargaining agreement , which the NFL and its players have been without since the strike of 1987 .
Former University of Tennessee quarterback Tony Robinson , who also was a replacement player for the Washington Redskins during the NFL players ' strike in 1987 , was arrested on a fugitive warrant for parole violation by Fairfax County , Va. , police .
FACT : Throwing out the strike year of 1982 -LRB- when the size of the playoff field doubled -RRB- , every NFL team except the Packers and the Cardinals played a postseason game in the 1980s .
Carney kicked for Notre Dame before being signed as a replacement player by Tampa Bay during the NFL 's 1987 strike .
Older brothers Kyle and Cary played linebacker for BYU , and both played for the Rams as replacements during the NFL strike in 1987 .
I remember the seven-week 1982 NFL strike fondly , as a time for Sunday puttering and family fun .
The five-year collective bargaining agreement that settled the 57-day 1982 strike expired Aug. 31 , leaving the NFL players without a contract .
During the 1982 strike , they bought far fewer souvenir items , a small , but growing source of NFL revenue .
A spokesman for NBC says that , so far , the network has only ruled out picking up games from the Canadian Football League , which NBC did during the 1982 players ' strike .
In 1982 , the NFL cut its rights fees by $ 110 million because of the players ' strike .
They note that after the 1982 strike , viewing levels for football did n't recover to 1981 levels for several seasons , a reduction they attribute in part to fan and audience backlash over the strike .
Reginald Brack Jr. , president and chief executive of Time Inc. 's magazine division , notes that during the last NFL strike , in 1982 , some NFL advertisers stepped up spending in Time publications ; he expects the same effect again , with Time , Sports Illustrated and People possibly receiving small boosts .
Baseball bounced back from its 1981 strike to set attendance records , and the fact that the NFL gate has n't quite recovered from the 57-day players ' walkout of 1982 -- the only one that disrupted regular-season play -- probably has as much to do with high ticket prices and full stadiums in many cities as fan disaffection .
NFL officials say it took the league three years to win back fans after the 1982 strike .

Both Voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields , electrically charged particles that make up solar wind , and waves in that wind .
The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that sweep around Venus .
This region contains mainly ions -LRB- charged atoms -RRB- and electrons emanating from the Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar space by the Sun 's hot breath , the solar wind .
On route to the Sun 's south pole , the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere : shock waves in the solar wind ; electromagnetic waves with a very long period -LRB- more than 10 hours -RRB- ; regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun ; enormous clouds of ionised gas ; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from elsewhere in the galaxy .
These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of the solar wind -- bursts of energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles through space and slam into the Earth 's magnetic field at a speed of 1.56 million m.p.h .
The sun normally emits a continuous stream of charged subatomic particles , called the solar wind .
The solar wind is the constant flow of particles , including protons and electrons , that stream out from the sun. ;

Also , abortion foe Wally Hickel was elected governor of Alaska as an independent and Pennsylvania 's anti-abortion Democratic Gov. Bob Casey was easily re-elected .
Walter Hickel was sworn in as Alaska 's first independent governor , declaring `` a new day for this great land '' and promising to protect the resource-rich state from outside interests .
Before his term as governor expired this week , Alaska 's Steve Cowper asked for $ 4.3 million more to pay escalating costs for fueling state cars , trucks and ferries .
Alaska : Wally Hickel back in governor 's mansion .
Governor Walter Hickel and Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska asked the union to let Sea-Land Freight Service , the big ocean freight link between Alaska and the rest of the United States , load ships .
Alaskan state governor Walter J. Hickel says : 'It is unthinkable that the Department of Interior would proceed with a proposal such as this one without consulting the State of Alaska . ' Responding to the suggestion that the federal government could include ANWR in a World Heritage Park , Hickel says : 'This is exactly the kind of unilateral federal decision-making that we fought for statehood over . '
Mr Walter Hickel , Alaska 's governor , said the agreement represented an 'equitable resolution of all significant tax disputes between the company and the state . '
Walter Hickel , a former Alaska governor and interior secretary in the Nixon cabinet , jumped into the race late in the game and won as an independent. ;
Alaska 's new governor , Walter J. Hickel , has expressed a desire to settle the case for about $ 1.2 billion , money that would be placed in trust to help pay for further research and restoration programs in the sound .
Governor full of ideas ; In an era when chief executives often dispatch difficult issues to study commissions and hope that they never return , Walter Joseph Hickel , Alaska 's new governor , takes getting used to .
A spokesman for Alaska Gov. Walter Hickel said the governor had pushed the lingering issue of civil damages while he was in Washington last week for President Bush 's unveiling of the administration 's national energy strategy. ;
Put your phasers on stun and hang on for the ride , because going where no one has gone before can be a bumpy business , and , after four Earth years , there 's no telling where Hickel -- and Alaska -- might end up. ; Twenty-five years after becoming Alaska 's second governor -- a term that was interrupted in 1969 for an abbreviated stint as President Richard M. Nixon 's interior secretary -- Hickel , 71 , a self-made millionaire and positive thinker with a penchant for megaprojects , is back as the state 's eighth governor . ; AFTER TWO unsuccessful attempts to return to office , Hickel entered last year 's race as an independent candidate less than two months before the election. ;
Alaska Governor Steve Cowper said the settlement `` marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the state and Arco which will mean a more amicable payment system and which also will lead to increased development on the North Slope . ''
Alaska Governor Walter Hickel yesterday said he still fully supports a settlement of civil claims even if the plea bargain fizzles .
Mr. Hickel , who previously served as governor in the 1960s , would n't be the first Alaska governor to face an impeachment threat .

The system is a small fuel cell that converts gas to electricity using thin films .
Ishikawa-Harima Heavy Industries Co. , Ltd. -LRB- IHI -RRB- has established the possibility of developing system control technology for a molten carbonate fuel cell -LRB- MCFC -RRB- plant scheduled to be built in FY97 , four years from now .
Mazda also recently tested its newly developed vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell -LRB- JIDOSHA GIJUTSU Aug 93 ; NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 18 Nov 93 -RRB- .
So far , 76 phosphoric acid -type fuel cell power plants -LRB- 18,500 kilowatts -RRB- have been installed in Japan -LRB- NIKAAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93 -RRB- .
After PAFCs , the next type of fuel cell targeted for development is expected to be the molten carbonate fuel cell -LRB- MCFC -RRB- .
According to the kind of electrolyte used , fuel cells are categorized into five types : Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell -LRB- PAFC -RRB- , Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell -LRB- MCFC -RRB- , Solid Oxide Fuel Cell -LRB- SOFC -RRB- , Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell -LRB- PEFC -RRB- , and Alkaline Fuel Cell -LRB- AFC -RRB- .
Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells MCFC technology is at the center of the fuel cell development project , since the cells serve as an alternative energy source to thermal power and use gasified coal as fuel .
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells R & D for fundamental SOFC technology started in 1981 and several 10-kW -class cell modules were successfully developed in 1991 .
NEDO , a semi-governmental organization founded in 1980 to promote national R / D projects on oil-alternative energy technology , has managed Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell -LRB- PAFC -RRB- , Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell -LRB- MCFC -RRB- , Solid Oxide Fuel Cell -LRB- SOFC -RRB- and Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell -LRB- PEFC -RRB- type of projects .
Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo has developed a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell -LRB- PEMFC -RRB- that uses platinum catalyst for electrodes .
Compared to a conventional phosphoric acid fuel cell -LRB- PAFC -RRB- , the maximum electrode output per square centimeter has been upgraded to 1.2 watts .
The idea is to raise the power generation efficiency , which is now limited to 26 % in the boiler systems that burn hydrogen , to 42 % or more by 1 -RRB- recycling the 20 % or so of hydrogen that is discharged from the fuel cell as is , without being reacted , and 2 -RRB- by using the 170ë water vapor that is produced during the reaction process for energy within the plant .
The LP Gas Promotion Center , Inc. -LRB- board chairperson : Kazuo Okita -RRB- and Fuji Electric Co. , Ltd. -LRB- Fuji Electric -RRB- , have jointly developed a 100-kW -output , phosphoric acid -type , pilot fuel cell that uses butane as fuel .
The cell 's generation efficiency is expected to be approximately 40 percent , which is comparable to that of fuel cells that use natural or propane gas .
If a fuel cell can use butane , it can also use propane .
The fuel cell is a proven technology , first developed in the UK by British scientists , and it has the potential to make electric transport the most clean and efficient of all possible in the near future .
The direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy in a simple hydrogen/oxygen -based fuel cell was achieved in 1839 by Sir William Grove in London .
Interest is now focused on the high-temperature type of fuel cell , and particularly solid oxide fuel cells which operate between 950 and 1 , 000degC and have sophisticated ceramic electrolytes .
It will also produce conceptual designs which will lead to both commercial and military applications of solid oxide fuel cell technology .
The company 's solid oxide fuel cell has already been sold for testing purposes to Japanese natural gas companies .

The building was known as the Texas Schoolbook Depository in 1963 when Kennedy was shot as he rode in a motorcade just outside the building .
The nine sentences noting the spot where Dallas was settled are followed by this : `` On Nov. 22 , 1963 , the building gained national notoriety when Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F. Kennedy from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade passed the site. ''
Kennedy , at 43 the youngest president elected , served nearly three years before he was shot and killed in a Dallas motorcade Nov. 22 , 1963 .
Here are some of the original news breaks as they were reported by The Associated Press between the time President John F. Kennedy was shot on Nov. 22 , 1963 , and the time his assassin was killed two days later .
In his 1966 book `` Rush to Judgment , '' Lane disputed the findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald alone shot and killed President Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas .

The disk-shaped Milky Way galaxy is not flat , but resembles instead a warped phonograph record and is adorned with a delicate , scalloped edge , new observations show .
The Milky Way , once considered merely a typical example of a spiral galaxy , is now thought to be a much more exciting and interesting aggregation .
More complete surveys of the heavens beyond our galaxy have been conducted using powerful optical and infrared telescopes aimed to look above or below the Milky Way 's flattened disk .
But such telescopes ca n't survey our own galaxy very well because visible light is blocked by tremendous amounts of dust between the Milky Way 's stars and because the galaxy is so full of infrared light sources that it 's hard to distinguish various objects , Becker said .
And Kelly laid on a Milky Way galaxy of stars and crescent moons in his stretch jersy numbers for evening .
During the 1920s , Carnegie astronomers Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason , using the Hooker telescope , established that the `` spiral nebulae '' in the night sky were other galaxies , made up of billions of stars and located far outside the Milky Way , the galaxy that contains the Earth .
By comparison , the earth 's Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light years across .
Astronomers have spotted the most distant known star in the Milky Way , and say the accidental discovery could help determine the total mass of the galaxy .
`` We do n't know the mass of the Milky Way , but if we can find objects that are far out and measure their speed , it will help us determine the galaxy 's total mass _ the visible areas and the dark areas. ''
Since the Earth is about 30,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way , the discovery means the galaxy is larger than even more recent estimates indicated .
Other reports will address the discovery of what are believed to be twin quasars , large stellar objects that emit powerful light and radio waves ; a new theory that suggests the Milky Way Galaxy , which includes the sun , may be shaped differently than previously believed ; and new findings on rapid movements of some galaxies that are close , in astronomical terms , to the Milky Way .
The Milky Way Galaxy , home of the sun and the Earth , has a core shaped like a football instead of the perfectly spherical center many astronomers have long believed , according to a new study .
Astronomers at the University of Maryland and Princeton University announced Thursday the discovery of evidence that the spiral arms of the Milky Way actually rotate around an oval center , causing the sun to follow an elliptical path in its 200 million-year orbit of the galaxy center .
Leo Blitz of the University of Maryland said that the discovery shows that the Milky Way is a so-called barred spiral galaxy .
`` It has been something of a holy grail for astronomers to determine if the Milky Way is a barred spiral or a normal spiral galaxy , '' said Blitz .
The Milky Way galaxy is disk-shaped with a large bulge in the middle .
In other galactic news , two other astronomers said Thursday they have confirmed that the Milky Way and about 100 other galaxies are being pulled toward a powerful gravitational source called `` the great attractor '' over a region of space 100 million light years wide .
That spoke , along with the four other arms of the Milky Way , rotate about the galaxy core .
Blitz and David Spergel of Princeton overcame this problem by examining the movement of hydrogen gas clouds in the outer regions of the Milky Way , an area called the galactic halo that surrounds the Milky Way like a globe .
Like an immense gravitational magnet , a vast celestial structure nicknamed `` the great attractor '' is pulling powerfully at the Milky Way and more than 100 other galaxies , causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of the nearby universe .
Their studies then showed that only galaxies on the same side as the Milky Way were being drawn toward the attractor .
Dressler said the structure stretches about 60 degrees across the Earth 's view of the sky , reaching from superclusters of galaxies known as Hydra and Centaurus , through the plane of the Milky Way , to the superclusters Pavo and Indus .
Astrophysicists David Helfand and Thomas Hamilton said they have found seven galaxies reasonably near the Earth 's own Milky Way galaxy that are spewing out X-rays at a hotter rate than the so-called background X-rays detectable all over the universe .
They surveyed galaxies in two opposite directions from the Milky Way galaxy , which includes Earth .
`` We usually work in a more distant part of the universe , and we pretty much assume that everything is already known about the vicinity of the Milky Way '' _ the galaxy around Earth .
The galaxy , named Sextans after the constellation where it was found , is the smallest of the 10 satellite galaxies of the Milky Way , the astronomers said in telephone interviews .
The dwarf , spherical galaxy is 100,000 times fainter than the Milky Way and can not be seen without a powerful telescope , they said .
`` The sun is 30,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way , and this particular galaxy is a factor of 10 farther out .
The dwarf is in the Milky Way , the galaxy which includes the sun , and is about 68 light-years away , the astronomers said .
The picture , which an official said was taken `` to prove to the public that the Hubble is not broken , '' shows a galaxy 400 times more tightly packed with stars than the sun 's own Milky Way galaxy .
`` We 've never been able to study any galaxy outside of our local group -LRB- two dozen galaxies near the Milky Way -RRB- at this resolution before , '' Lauer said .
After all , our own Milky Way galaxy contains an estimated 300bn-400bn stars .
Giant `` blobs '' of material have been discovered around a mysterious object near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy , leading scientists to believe they may be getting their best look yet at one of the most baffling objects in the universe -- a black hole .
They hope that additional study will unmask Sagittarius A and prove it to be the long-sought but never seen black hole that scientists suspect lurks at the heart of the Milky Way Galaxy .
But he is confident that the research he presented Wednesday goes a long way toward proving that a black hole does lie at the center of any galaxy , and in our own Milky Way , the most likely candidate is Sagittarius A .
Now , in a handful of days , it makes its final rendezvous , a close brush and embrace with Neptune , before flying out of the solar system to begin an odyssey through the Milky Way galaxy ; an unattended , lonely voyage that may last from millions to billions of years .
The `` eclipsing millisecond pulsar , '' the massive remnant of an exploded sun , and its companion white dwarf star are located in Terzan 5 , a globular star cluster near the center of the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of about 24,000 light years .
Astrophysicists had grown comfortable with the theory that the bursts -- 100,000 times as luminous as the sun but invisible to the eye because of their wavelength -- originated in explosions or `` starquakes '' on the surfaces of neutron stars within our own Milky Way galaxy .
Neutron theory flaws ; But if that theory were true , as recent observations using the Soviet spacecraft GRANAT seemed to confirm , the Gamma Ray Observatory 's detector would have shown most of the bursts coming from the center of the Milky Way galaxy 's disk -- a flattened pinwheel of stars with Earth and the solar system located toward the end of one of the arms .

The unnamed planet is perhaps 12 times as massive as Earth and orbits a dense neutron star not far from the center of the Milky Way galaxy , according to the British team that made the discovery .
Astronomers reported they have detected at least two planets orbiting a dense star in the Milky Way galaxy , raising the prospect that planetary systems may be more common than had been thought .

Michelangelo was not , contrary to popular belief , an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his back as he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , a Washington University art historian concludes .
The collection of 46 composition sketches under the title `` Michelangelo : Draftsman @ Architect '' will include the artist 's graphic work , including several studies for the Sistine Chapel ceiling in Rome .
Jennifer Brown is n't looking for a little Michelangelo , but she did teach her middle school art students something about the difficulties of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
`` Michelangelo painted figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , so we painted hands instead , which is a part of the body , at least , '' she said .
The Extraterrestrial , '' and Michaelangelo 's ceiling in the Sistine Chapel .
On this date : In 1512 , Michelangelo 's paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were first exhibited to the public .
Michelangelo 's `` Creation of Adam '' painted on the ceiling of the Vatican 's Sistine Chapel contains an image misunderstood for 478 years - a huge brain that symbolizes God bestowing intellect on man , a doctor says .
On the right side is Michelangelo 's Adam from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
Vatican to Celebrate Sistine Restoration : The Vatican plans an exhibition , an international symposium and books to mark the completion of the restoration of Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes .
The Vatican today unveiled a multimillion-dollar restoration -- paid for by a Japanese television network -- of one of the world 's greatest art treasures , the ceiling Michelangelo painted for the Sistine Chapel .
The painting under review is a figure of a naked Adam , and it reminds me of another naked Adam on public view -- on -LRB- the -RRB- Sistine -LRB- Chapel -RRB- ceiling , by Michelangelo .
The segment on Vatican City includes the Ponte Vittoria Emanuele -LRB- bridge -RRB- , Castel Sant-Angelo and St. Peter 's for scenes of the Pope , the Vatican Gardens and museums and the Sistine Chapel dominated by Michelangelo 's monumental ceiling .
The highlight is a visit to the Sistine Chapel and its ceiling for close studies and a history of Michelangelo 's magnificent work .
`` If Michelangelo had broken into the Sistine Chapel and sprayed the ceiling , that 's graffiti , that 's not art , '' said Gerald A. Silver , president of Homeowners of Encino. ; Graffiti has developed from the turf marking and public threats of the street gangs , to the tagging of rebellious youth , to `` piecing , '' in which crews of spray -can painters `` throw up '' their masterpieces on the wall .
Despite the artist 's grim realism , his eye for grisly detail , the wasted bodies near death are as beautiful as those vital bodies on the ceiling of Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel .

Acid rain results from the conversion of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels into sulfuric and nitric acids in the atmosphere .
Nitrogen oxide , an important component of auto emissions , later turns into nitric acid in the atmosphere , and along with sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide emissions creates the acid rain which environmentalists blame for the death of aquatic life in sensitive lakes and streams .
The information was provided by the Natural Resources Defense Council , a Washington , D.C. -based , non-profit group that has lobbied for sharp reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain , such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides .
The meeting concentrated on the portion of the bill seeking to curb acid rain , a form of pollution caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from power plants , autos and other sources .
Environmentalists have considered the acid rain section the strongest part of the legislation , because it would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of 2000 and `` cap '' the lower emissions figure to prevent growth of the pollutant in the 21st century .
Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are chemically transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric or nitric acids , sometimes carried hundreds of miles in the air , and return to earth in rain or snow .
Both the administration and Baucus-Mitchell plans are designed to reduce the major component of acid rain , sulfur dioxide , by 10 million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after the reductions are achieved .
Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide , and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down to earth .
Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which mixes in the atmosphere and can be carried hundreds of miles before falling back to earth as rain , snow , fog and dust particles .
Acid rain is a blanket term for a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as rain , snow , fog or dust particles .
Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as rain , snow , fog and dust particles .
In his clean-air legislation , President Bush proposed a 10 million-ton reduction by the turn of the century in sulfur dioxide , one of the main ingredients in acid rain .
Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxide and other pollutants that can fall to earth as rain , snow , sleet , fog or dust particles .
Sulfur dioxide , nitrogen and other acid rain -causing emissions originate from the burning of fossil fuel , such as coal and oil .
Acid rain is formed when airborne sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are transformed into sulfuric and nitric acids .
The Mitchell -Baucus proposal retains the main acid rain provisions of the President 's bill , which would require public utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants by 10 million tons by the year 2000 .

Taxi drivers quote prices in gold instead of in Brazil 's weak cruzado currency .
The `` cruzeiro '' is Brazil 's fourth currency in as many years .
Only then will the new real come into circulation , substituting for the URV , ending the real cruzeiro , and it will be the new currency of a Brazil without inflation .
Argentina has fixed its exchange rate against the dollar , which has led to a real appreciation of its currency , while Brazil is devaluing the cruzeiro in line with its inflation rate .
Once the unit is widely in use , it will become a full currency called the Real and will be linked to Brazil 's Dollars 32bn foreign exchange reserves to give it credibility .
Brazil yesterday unveiled details of its plan to replace the currency , the cruzeiro real , which is plagued by annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent .
Brazil is next week expected to announce the first steps towards a new currency to replace the inflation-plagued cruzeiro real .
Brazil 's government plans to increase minimum wages by nearly 8 per cent from September , in a move that could undermine efforts to beat inflation through the Real currency , due to be launched on Friday .
In an effort to cut inflation from around 50 per cent a month , Brazil intends to link the Real at parity with the US dollar and limit the amount of the new currency to be issued .
Brazil 's new currency , the Real , has sent inflation tumbling and public support soaring .
Mr Antonio Delfim Netto , an economic commentator and former planning minister , says inflation will stay low for about six months but he does not believe the Real is the 'strong ' currency Brazil has been promised .
From midnight last night , all bank accounts in Brazil were switched electronically from cruzeiro real to the Real -LRB- RDollars -RRB- , the new currency which the country 's monetary masters hope will wipe out an inflation rate of 50 per cent a month .
Mr Cardoso 's extraordinary rise in the polls , from about 20 per cent in June to more than double that figure today , would not have been possible without the Real , Brazil 's new currency launched on July 1 .
Both trends have accelerated this year following the launch in July of Brazil 's new currency , the Real .
Such monthly increases were common before the introduction , on July 1 , of Brazil 's new currency , the Real , under the anti-inflation plan .
During the interview Mr Ricupero suggested he , and the government , were using Brazil 's latest anti-inflation plan and its main component , a new currency , the Real , to help Mr Cardoso win votes .
Brazil , a market of 150m and Argentina 's largest trading partner , is witnessing a 'vigorous recovery of demand ' , thanks to the initial success of the Real currency plan , says Mr Domingo Cavallo , Argentine economy minister .
The choice of Mr Malan suggests the economic team which oversaw this year 's launch of Brazil 's new currency , the Real , will remain largely intact , although in different posts , following the change of government .
To distinguish between frozen funds and circulating money , the government changed the name of Brazil 's currency from novo cruzado back to cruzeiro , the name it had until 1986 .

Reiman said that by inducing anxiety in the volunteers , the researchers were able to compare the blood flow pattern in normal , anxious brains with that of patients who experience panic disorder , an emotional illness that includes unprovoked and inappropriate feelings of great fear and anxiety .
In earlier PET studies , he said , the researchers learned that patients with panic disorder also experience a sharply increased flow of blood to the temporal lobes of the brain , the same areas affected by the normal anxiety felt among the volunteers in the study .
Sixty - nine percent of the people qualified for diagnosis of panic attacks or another anxiety disorder , based on their answers to the survey , said Kane , psychiatry professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston .
Doyle , who is leading a psychiatric association effort to help physicians recognize panic disorder , said many doctors overlook anxiety when analyzing physical symptoms .
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first medication for the treatment of panic disorder , a disease that will affect 3 million Americans at some point in their lifetimes .
Panic disorder is characterized by repeated panic attacks in which a patient is struck by intense fear .
People who experience panic attacks are more likely than others to attempt or consider suicide , according to a new study that researchers say should prompt physicians to take more seriously an anxiety disorder afflicting millions of Americans .
`` Those who suffer from the disorder often face ridicule , '' said Dr. Andrew Slabee , medical director of Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit , N.J. ; Doctors say panic disorder combines an attack of panic with real physical symptoms. ;
thinking or anticipatory anxiety and avoids more and more situations , '' said Meg McGarrah , director of the Anxiety Disorder Self-Help Group Network in Rockville , Md. ; A combination of factors including heredity , biochemistry and an overload of stress often act as a catalyst that sets the first panic attack into motion. ;
It is less common that a single event like a car accident or a fire will bring on an attack. ; Slabee theorizes that panic disorder is actually part of a double anxiety some people experience. ;
The anxiety disorder group network estimates that 2.9 million Americans , or 1.6 percent , experience panic disorder at some time in their lives. ;

`` World population , now 5.1 billion , grew by an unprecedented 90 million people last year .
The world 's population , which edged past the 5 billion mark just a year ago , could double within 40 years , the Population Reference Bureau said in its annual `` World Population Data Sheet . ''
In July 1987 , the world 's population passed 5 billion , double the population in 1950 .
China will have 1.49 billion people by 2025 , India 1.44 billion and the Soviet Union 351.4 million , according to the report , which said world population was 5.1 billion in mid-1988 and will reach 6 billion in 1998 .
She said world population , now 5.2 billion , `` is at a critical juncture , '' likely to increase by more than 90 million a year until the end of the century and stabilize at 10 billion about a century from now .
With the world 's population at 5.2 billion and current growth at 90 million people a year the United Nations forecasts a stable population of 10 billion about a hundred years from now .
Conable said the world 's population , currently about 5 billion , will grow to 6 billion by the year 2000 , adding to the use of fossil fuels that is blamed for the greenhouse effect and atmospheric warming .
The U.N. Population Fund estimates the current world population is nearly 5.3 billion people .
He said the current world population of 5.3 billion is 1.8 billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of overpopulation in his book `` The Population Bomb . ''
Erlich said the current world population of 5.3 billion is 1.8 billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of overpopulation in his book `` The Population Bomb . ''
The world 's population of 5.3 billion may nearly triple in the next century and pose a serious threat to the environment unless family planning efforts are redoubled , according to a U.N. report released today .
Authors Francis Urban and Michael Trueblood of the department 's Economic Research Service noted that the world population passed 5 billion in 1987 and as of the writing in 1990 stood at 5.3 billion .
The report predicts that the world 's population , currently 5.4bn , will rise by a further 1bn by the end of the decade .
As the text 's preamble explains , the world 's population will have risen from the present 5.6bn people to between 7.8bn and 12.5bn by 2050 , according to low and high variants of present UN projections .
Worldwide spending on family planning needs to treble to Dollars 17bn -LRB- Pounds 11bn -RRB- by the end of the decade if the world 's population , now 5.7bn , is to be stabilised at about 7.8bn , the United Nations population fund said .
The world 's population is expected to pass 5.4 billion sometime this year . ;
Despite an expected slower rate of growth , the world 's population in that year should represent a 27 % increase from the mid-1985 total of 4.9 billion people , the forecast said .
If Judas had sold his 30 pieces of silver at one cent a piece -LRB- a conservative figure -RRB- in A.D. 30 and reinvested at 4 % compounded annually until 1988 -LRB- I 'm uncertain of the date of his newsletter -RRB- , his portfolio would be worth $ 6.7 x 10 -LRB- 32 -RRB- , which , assuming a world population of five billion -LRB- also a conservative figure -RRB- , would provide $ 1.3 x 10 -LRB- 32 -RRB- for every man , woman and child in the world .
In July 1987 , the world 's population passed five billion , double the population in 1950 .

Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the principal gas whose buildup in the atmosphere trapping the earth 's heat is blamed by many scientists for the warming trend .
A colorless , odorless gas , carbon dioxide allows warmth from the sun to continue heating the Earth , but keeps portions of the Earth 's warmth from radiating out into space .
The first two chapters deal with historical levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and global emissions of the gas from various sources .
Carbon dioxide , a colorless , odorless gas , is a major focus of the so-called greenhouse warming problem .
The carbon element would penalise fuels with high emissions of carbon dioxide , the gas widely blamed for global warming .
Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming .
This system , proponents claim , could control global emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , while allowing developing countries to continue industrialisation - a process that involves more use of fossil fuels and so CO emissions .
Patterns of travel influence emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , and would have to be changed , the guidelines say .
This is a central issue in the climate change debate as forests act as 'sinks ' to absorb carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas contributing to global warming .
The plan relies mainly on voluntary measures intended to encourage the use of more energy-efficient cars , lights and other equipment ; this would reduce the burning of fossil fuels and so cut emissions of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide , produced when organic material , including fossil fuels , is burnt .
In August , 1986 , Nyos , a jewel-like crater lake , erupted with a burst of deadly carbon dioxide gas that killed 1,700 people .
A dense , colorless gas , carbon dioxide weighs 1 1/2 times as much as air .

An undersea explorer who found a wrecked pirate ship four years ago believes he can locate the site of the Boston Tea Party and hopes to recover some of the 342 chests dumped into Boston Harbor in 1773 .
On Dec. 16 , 1773 , 30 patriots , dressed as American Indians , raided three ships in Boston Harbor , hauling crates containing tea chests to the decks , opening the chests and throwing them into the ocean .
The Boston Tea Party commenced just after dusk on Dec. 16 , 1773 , when 30 patriots , angered over King George III 's three -penny tax on a pound of tea , raided three ships , the Eleanor , the Dartmouth and the Beaver .
Today 's highlight in history : In 1773 , the Boston Tea Party took place as American colonists , disguised as Indians , boarded a British ship in Boston Harbor and dumped more than 300 chests of tea overboard in a protest against taxes .

Matthew Alexander Henson was the first to reach the North Pole and planted the American flag there exactly 79 years earlier during a trek with Adm. Robert E. Peary and four Eskimos .
A British Arctic expert says that Robert Peary , credited with being the first explorer to reach the North Pole , may actually have missed the top of the world by 30 to 60 miles , The New York Times reported today .
New knowledge of Arctic weather , currents and ice drift and analysis of Robert Peary 's documents indicate the explorer hailed as the first person to reach the North Pole may have missed the mark by 30 to 60 miles , a British Arctic expert says .
Newly uncovered notes kept by Robert E. Peary show the explorer claimed to be the first person to reach the North Pole even though he knew he had n't come closer than 121 miles , an astronomer and historian says .
Rawlins ' findings , published Wednesday in the Washington Post , are the latest salvo in an 80-year geographical dispute over whether Peary was the first to reach the North Pole , and , if not , whether he knew how far off the mark he had been .
A Baltimore astronomer and historian says he 's found long-suppressed evidence that shows explorer Robert E. Peary was not the first man to reach the North Pole , but had stopped 121 miles short of his goal .
The controversy over who was first to reach the North Pole erupted even before Adm. Robert E. Peary returned from his famous 1909 trek .
According to Rawlins , notes kept by Peary show the explorer claimed to be the first person to reach the North Pole even though he knew he had n't come closer than 121 miles .
Ralph Plaisted 's 1968 snowmobile trip to the pole would make him the first person to reach the spot overland if Peary failed to get there .
The discrediting of Peary 's claim means Plaisted will take his place beside such polar record holders as Roald Amundsen of Norway , who in 1911 was the first person to reach the South Pole and in 1926 reached the North Pole by airboat , and Joseph Fletcher , the first person to stand at the North Pole after flying there in 1925 .

The efficiency of conversion from light energy to electric energy by solar cells drops when temperature rises , so experiments will be carried out to search for an effective way to cool solar cells in Malaysia , where high temperatures prevail .
As has been noted , the development of the two technologies has always been accompanied by advantages and disadvantages : reduced costs but low conversion factors -LRB- 10-14 percent -RRB- in the case of silicon solar cells ; in the case of gallium arsenide cells however , the performance is doubled but with costs up to four times higher .
The performance levels , which are double those of silicon , could promote research and new developments in single equipment for domestic use , the testing of concentration devices from current photovoltaic centers on new types of cells , or attract the interest of the Nordic countries , which receive less sunlight , in the new solar panels , given the increased performance of new GaAs cells in interplanetary spaces even at temperatures of minus 150 degrees Celsius and in the absence of light .
Solar photovoltaic cells , which convert sunlight to electricity , could provide an unlimited supply of non-polluting energy .
But recently scientists have been making rapid progress in improving the efficiency of photovoltaic cells which convert solar radiation directly into electricity .
In recent years , photovoltaics -LRB- solar cells that produce free electricity -RRB- have become much more energy-efficient and cost effective .
Also expected are light-colored or white roofs that will reflect sunlight and lower cooling costs , and banks of on-site residential solar cells for generating electricity from sunlight .
Approximately 1,500 solar cells collect and funnel energy to batteries , which provide additional power when the car is moving .
But solar cells remain fairly inefficient at converting sunlight to energy , and the race cars can reach those speeds only because they weigh about 700 pounds . ;

Luxembourg , 12 March -- Just as Alfons Verplaetse , the governor of the National Bank of Belgium , fights not only for the credibility of the Belgian currency , but also for the stability of the Luxembourg franc , so do Netherlands diplomats look after the interests of not only the Kingdom of the Netherlands , but also those of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in many parts of the world .
When it comes to `` monetary union , '' the prime minister points out , it has been possible to keep the Belgian - Luxembourg franc within the hard currency group .
Still , to many people in Luxembourg , a single European currency is preferable to the link with the Belgian franc .
The Luxembourg and Belgian franc are part of a currency union .
The initial targets for international financial speculators were 'soft-core ' currencies such as the British pound and the Italian lira ; but in the spring and summer of 1993 , the assault shifted to the 'hard-core ' grouping including the French franc , the Danish krone and the Belgian franc , which remains linked in a 71-year-old currency association to the Luxembourg franc .
The recent weakness of the Belgian franc has touched a raw nerve because it evoked memories of the 1982 currency crisis in which the Brussels authorities devalued their currency unilaterally , without consulting Luxembourg .
LUXEMBOURG is examining what impact a devaluation of the Belgian franc would have on the 71-year-old currency link between the two countries .
It would also leave the Luxembourg franc exposed to heavy speculation on international currency markets .
Luxembourg has examined cutting the link with the Belgian franc once before , in 1982 , after the currency was devalued .
Relinquishing the Belgian franc peg would prove very damaging for Luxembourg 's 200 or so banks , which have substantial assets in the Belgian currency , especially bonds .
Earlier this year , Major launched an alternative proposal to establish not a single currency for all of Europe but a pan-European currency that could be used even as the existing 11 currencies -LRB- Belgium and Luxembourg share the Belgian franc -RRB- stayed in use .

THE PEOPLE _ Venezuela has 18.43 million people , and its population is growing at a rate of 2.9 percent , one of the highest rates in Latin America .
VENEZUELA -LRB- population 19 million -RRB- _ A civilian-military rebellion in January 1958 ended nearly five decades of military dictatorship during which democratic governments were few and short-lived .
Investors familiar with Latin America have long been aware of Venezuela 's competitive advantages , which include : low-cost energy from abundant hydroelectric power and large reserves of fossil fuels ; major deposits of minerals such as iron ore , bauxite , gold , diamonds , coal and others ; the largest proved reserves of crude oil outside the Middle East , plus large gas deposits ; a modern physical infrastructure ; a young work force and a corps of managers experienced in international business ; a good location for reaching markets in the US , Europe and Latin America ; a relatively small population -LRB- about 20m -RRB- with manageable problems .
Roughly half of Venezuela 's population of about 20m are registered to vote for 22 state governors , 282 mayors , 2,116 members of city councils and 2,376 members of the newly established parish councils .
Elsewhere in the region , the other key economies in terms of GDP and population size are Colombia -LRB- population 36m ; GDP Dollars 50bn -RRB- ; Chile -LRB- population 14m ; GDP Dollars 40bn -RRB- ; Peru -LRB- population 22m ; GDP Dollars 47bn -RRB- ; Venezuela -LRB- population 20m ; GDP Dollars 64bn -RRB- ; Ecuador -LRB- population 11m ; GDP Dollars 14bn -RRB- and Bolivia -LRB- population 7.5m ; GDP Dollars 6.75bn -RRB- .

Argentina changed its currency in January , replacing the austral with the peso .
The measures , which amount to an indirect 5 - 10 per cent devaluation of the peso became inevitable as Argentina 's currency became increasingly overvalued .
The plan has also fuelled further appreciation of Brazil 's currency against Argentina 's dollar-pegged peso , making Argentine goods more competitive .
Far from 'flexibilising ' the convertibility plan - by which the law handcuffs the peso to the dollar and forbids the Central Bank from issuing unbacked local currency - Argentina would make it 'more rigorous and pure ' , he said .
Because the dollar has an important presence in Argentina 's financial system , where about half of deposits are in the US currency , high peso interest rates need not have an immediate effect on economic activity .
`` It was a compulsive wave of purchases to unload their australs -LRB- Argentina 's currency -RRB- before they lost value .
ARGENTINA TO FLOAT AUSTRAL : Argentina 's new economy minister , Antonio Erman Gonzalez , announced that the country 's currency , the austral , will be allowed to float against the dollar and that all foreign-exchange controls will be scrapped as part of a plan to beat the country 's hyper-inflation .
Financial sources said the plan includes a wage and price freeze ; a tax increase ; establishment of a two-tier exchange-rate system , one tier aimed at importers and exporters and the other at financial institutions ; and a new devaluation of the austral , Argentina 's currency , that is expected to be much smaller than last Friday 's devaluation of 12.96 % .
The first measure will probably be a devaluation today of the austral , Argentina 's currency , of as much as 10 % , and other changes in the country 's foreign-exchange policy .
Argentine industry also has been given an extra incentive to export , as it will be allowed to sell goods abroad at an exchange rate between the controlled and financial rates for the austral , Argentina 's currency .
ARGENTINA TO REPLACE CURRENCY Argentina early next year will replace the austral with a currency unit called the peso that will be valued at $ 1 , Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said .
The peso will be Argentina 's fifth currency in 22 years .
ARGENTINA GETS NEW CURRENCY The peso , Argentina 's fifth currency in 22 years , replaced the austral , which inflation made virtually worthless .

The drugs are aimed at three categories of disease : cancer , immune-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , and cardiovascular disease .
The agreement , which involves Suntory paying Dollars 12m in fees and buying Dollars 3m worth of Xenova shares , is to develop drugs for immune-inflammatory diseases - particularly rheumatoid arthritis .
Crippling pain is associated with inflammation-linked diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , asthma and Crohn 's disease -LRB- inflammation of the colon -RRB- , and the condition is often fatal in the case of trauma , organ transplant rejection and certain cardiovascular complications .
Scientistsat the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology spoke of a 'breakthrough ' as they published the results of a trial of an experimental drug on 20 patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis - the most common cause of severe inflammation ofthe joints .
The two will also collaborate on research into autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis .
In autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , the immune system apparently malfunctions , attacking the joints and skin respectively .
Although no cure is in sight for the painful , debilitating disease rheumatoid arthritis , new treatments promise to do a better job of relieving symptoms of sufferers .
Whatever the cause of rheumatoid arthritis , though , the result is an inflammation of the joints that can cause stiffness , fluid accumulation , fatigue and weight loss in addition to pain .
Another so-called `` pathway '' of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis is through the effects on tissue of an enzyme called cyclooxygenose , he said .
She starting developing a variety of debilitating diseases : rheumatoid arthritis that made it painful for her to walk ; scleroderma that tightened her skin and made her hollow-eyed , and chronic lymph , kidney and liver problems .
She developed a variety of debilitating diseases : rheumatoid arthritis that made it painful for her to walk ; scleroderma that tightened her skin and made her hollow-eyed ; chronic lymph , kidney and liver problems .
However , according to the May issue of Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America , this is of scientific interest but `` probably not very important clinically because non-steroidal inflammatory drugs -LRB- such as Naprosyn , Nuprin or Advil -RRB- are more potent -LRB- than fish oil -RRB- and are well tolerated by the population at large. '' ; Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by symmetrical inflammation of the joints -- usually wrists and fingers , and often knees , shoulders , hips and the spine. ;
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation , pain and swelling of the joints .
By deliberately throwing cells into anergy , researchers also hope to control allergies and certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , in which white blood cells attack the body 's connective tissue in the joints . ;
The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the most common form of the crippling disorder .
Human rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks its own joint cartilage , causing inflammation and destruction of the joints .
Pain is one symptom of rheumatoid arthritis , but there are many other symptoms of this complex autoimmune disease .
Tocor , which went public in mid-1989 , is developing products to treat three autoimmune diseases -- rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus -- using monoclonal antibody technology .
Immune Response is a biopharmaceutical concern engaged in developing products for treatment of HIV infection and such other autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis .

Methane is another such gas , and natural gas is almost all methane .
In the area of fossil fuel energies , the institute plans to continue working on research to perfect the natural gas/ methanol cycle , and at the same time promote research on methane hydrates , which are non-conventional sources of natural gas , by the electric power and gas companies .
To their delight , the mixture began producing traces of methane , the flammable ingredient of natural gas .
DURING THE FUEL shortage of the early 1970s , the natural gas industry , through its Gas Research Institute in Chicago , started supporting research into ways to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane .
Now , when there are plentiful supplies of methane or natural gas , the gas institute has switched to finding new uses and markets for methane while continuing to support on a modest scale basic research for turning carbon dioxide and water into methane .
Natural gas , which is 90 % to 95 % methane , is too plentiful and cheap .

Actor Tom Cruise and his wife Nicole Kidman accepted `` substantial '' libel damages on Thursday from a British newspaper that reported he was gay and that their marriage was a sham to cover it up .
For example , the late Stanley Kubrick 's secrecy-shrouded `` Eyes Wide Shut '' is trading highly at H $ 68 , but investors could take a bath if the on-screen chemistry between married co-stars Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise fizzles .
A judge has given the green light to a lawsuit brought against the Star newspaper after it reported Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman had help from sex therapists in filming `` Eyes Wide Shut . ''
The drama is said to be about a pair of married psychiatrists -LRB- played by the married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman -RRB- and their sexual lives , but only a few Warner executives , Cruise and Kidman , and Pat Kingsley , a top public relations executive , have seen the film .

The Holy See , representing a billion believers , and the Lutheran World Federation , with a flock of 57 million , announced an accord on `` justification , '' the doctrine that first caused Martin Luther to launch the Protestant Reformation .
On Oct. 31 , 1517 , Martin Luther posted the 95 Theses on the door of the Wittenberg Palace church , marking the start of the Protestant Reformation in Germany .
The date was chosen specially by Josef Goebbels , Hitler 's propagandist , to honor the birthday of Martin Luther , the 16th century monk who was a father of the Protestant Reformation and the founder of what became the Lutheran church .
This package of stories offers a historical perspective on the church in Europe , with its roots in Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation , and examines why the European church today faces serious problems .
MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little time in the pews , but the history of northern Germany , the birthplace of the Protestant Reformation , can be traced through three churches : The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed the theses that started the Reformation ; the Berliner Dom , or great emperial cathedral , that survived the tremendous forces that shaped 20th century East Berlin ; and , St. Michael 's in Hamburg , a city famous for its churches and its red-light district , where the rebuilding of St. Michael 's after World War II has become a major point of pride for the city .
Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed , Methodist , Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther sparked .

At 8 p.m. EDT Friday -LRB- 0000 GMT Saturday -RRB- , the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Georges was located at 13.9 north latitude and 49.2 west longitude , about 790 miles -LRB- 1,265 kilometers -RRB- west of the Lesser Antilles .
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said sustained winds had increased to an estimated 125 mph -LRB- 205 kph -RRB- and hurricane-force winds extended 60 miles -LRB- 95 kilometers -RRB- from the center .
The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a hurricane warning for eastern Honduras and said those in Belize , Mexico 's Yucatan peninsula and western Cuba should monitor the dangerous Category 4 hurricane .
It was moving toward the northwest at 10 mph , and was expected to gradually turn toward the west-northwest and slow down over the next 24 hours , the National Hurricane Center in Miami said .
'' It is rather unusual to have such a strong tropical cyclone in the east Pacific during the month of May , '' the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami , Fla. , said in a report .
The storm , centered about 515 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands , had top sustained winds of 75 mph , passing the 74 mph threshold to become Hurricane Alberto , said Miles Lawrence , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami .
'' It could get caught up by the westerly winds and just become a big storm with high winds in the western Atlantic , '' said Stacy Stewart , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami .
'' Florence will have an opportunity to restrengthen to hurricane status once it begins to move away from its present location toward warmer waters , '' said Lixion Avila , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami .
'' Florence will have an opportunity to re-strengthen to hurricane status once it begins to move away from its present location toward warmer waters , '' said Lixion Avila , a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami .

The Supreme Court today refused to kill a copyright lawsuit in which a news service that videotaped the beating of trucker Reginald Denny during the 1992 Los Angeles riots seeks payment for unauthorized showings overseas .
Riots erupted in Los Angeles in April 1992 when four of the officers were acquitted in neighboring Ventura County .
The play , culled from hundreds of interviews , is not as focused as Smith 's previous works , '' Fires in the Mirror '' -- dealing with the tense relationship between blacks and Jews in Brooklyn 's Crown Heights -- or '' Twilight : Los Angeles , 1992 , '' which examined the rioting after the police beating of Rodney King .
Auditors questioned nearly $ 900,000 claimed by the California Highway Patrol during the Los Angeles riots in April 1992 sparked by the acquittal of four white officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King .
'' This raises the specter of Los Angeles in 1992 , '' Houston activist Travis Morales shouted .
He said he went to film school to learn how to make art- house movies but awakened to a reality during the Los Angeles riots of 1992 .
That number dipped to 20.9 million in 1992 , the year of the Los Angeles Riots .
The new pavilion _ actually a whole new building , designed by Gyo Obata , architect of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington _ triples the size of the original museum , which had the bad luck to open in 1992 on the first day of the Los Angeles riots .
1992 : Riots break out in Los Angeles , sparked by the acquittal of four white police officers caught on videotape beating Rodney King , a black motorist .
1993 : Cornel West , progressive postmodern philosopher , finds a mainstream audience with the publication of his text `` Race Matters , '' which examines the black community around the time of the 1992 Los Angeles riots .
On the block was a photograph of the Los Angeles riots , `` Pico Boulevard at 6 : 45 P.M. , 4/30/92 . ''
Riots Revisited '' comes up with no revelations , it does bring back the striking failure of the Los Angeles police to contain , much less control , the April 1992 riots that left much of the city ablaze .
McCain 's attack Monday on the religious right leaders , Pat Robertson and Rev. Jerry Falwell , for fostering `` the politics of division and slander '' was reminiscent of Clinton 's tactic in 1992 when he admonished Rev. Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow Coalition for hosting a rap singer , Sister Souljah , who had spoken of the Los Angeles riots in words Clinton said were `` filled with a kind of hatred. ''
Several days into the 1992 Los Angeles riots , as exhausted police officers on 12-hour shifts had just about restored order , a patrol supervisor walked into the Rampart District station house and encountered a scene that made him angry .
In 1992 , as scores of other businesses and buildings were being burned to the ground during the riots after the acquittal of Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist , Rodney King , a group of regulars stood outside and told looters that the Bowl was `` our place. ''
This was after he had spoken of Terry Glenn , Bill Parcells , the 1992 Los Angeles riots , Bryant Gumbel , Tiger Woods , linen suits , Johnny Most , Al Groh , Willie McGinest , Pete Carroll , dogged defenses , Bill Belichick , and Greg Kite .
Los Angeles police , mindful of the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of four white officers for beating black motorist Rodney King and currently embroiled in a major police corruption scandal , are as anxious as the Democratic Party for the convention to go well .

The center is a part of the Oklahoma City National Memorial for victims of the April 19 , 1995 , bombing of a federal building that killed 168 .
`` This team will put together the chapters that tell a complete storyline of what happened April 19 , 1995 , '' said Bob Johnson , chairman of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation trust .
The Supreme Court today left intact Timothy McVeigh 's conviction and death sentence for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more -- the worst such attack on U.S. soil .
Nichols was convicted last December of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction in the April 19 , 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City , but acquitted of federal murder charges in the deaths of eight federal agents who died .
In 1995 , in response to security concerns raised by the Oklahoma City bombing , the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was closed to traffic .
But many of the bomb experts working here were also involved in the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 , in which 168 people died .
In 1995 , amid rumors of anti-government militias and hidden caches of guns , Federal and state agents combed St. Mary 's and its surroundings for links to Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols , who had traveled in the area just before the Oklahoma City bombing .
In ruling that he could be , the judge in the case , John S. Martin Jr. of U.S. District Court , concluded that he did not `` perceive any substantial danger '' in allowing Felipe to join in the fence talks with McVeigh , who is awaiting execution for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people , or Kaczynski , who is serving a life term for his deadly letter bomb campaign .
`` People want to connect in visceral ways , and one of the ways to do this is to leave things , '' said Edward T. Linenthal , a professor of religion and American culture at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh , who is writing a book about the memorial to victims of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 .
In 1995 , after a bomb-laden truck destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , visitors flocked to the chain-link fence around the site .
Jon Hansen , an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City , likened the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing on April 19 , 1995 : `` It looks like the Murrah Building , but instead of nine stories tall , it 's spread out over a large area. ''
OKLAHOMA CITY _ The deadly April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building followed by last year 's devastating tornadoes have left an image of Oklahoma City as a smoking ruin inhabited by a doomed population .
He referred to the apparently incorrect early speculation that the April 19 , 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City might have been the work of foreign terrorists .
WASHINGTON , April 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The prosecution today opened its case in Denver against Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh , accusing him of murdering innocent men , women and children in 1995 .
The bombing of a Federal Building in Oklahoma city on April 19 , 1995 , killed 168 people and injured hundreds of others .
WASHINGTON , January 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Jurors in the second trial of Oklahoma bombing are scheduled to begin considering whether Terry Nichols should die for conspiring to carry out the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 .
WASHINGTON , September 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A U.S. federal appeals court upheld Tuesday the conviction and death sentence of Timothy McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing which killed 168 people .

The incident occurred while coalition aircraft were conducting Operation Southern Watch , the name given to the deny-flight mission established by allies who fought in the 1991 Persian Gulf War .
Speaking to a gathering at the American Enterprise Institute , Butler said the turning point occurred when Annan sent three envoys to Baghdad to discuss the Security Council resolutions on Iraq that were passed after the Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
Albright said Iraq was pumping all the oil it could and that the revenue provided '' caloric intake '' for Iraqi children that was higher than before the 1991 Persian Gulf war .
Since it lost the Persian Gulf war in 1991 , Baghdad has insisted that it has disclosed the extent of its biological and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles and the means to make them , but U.N. inspectors have ferreted out evidence to the contrary .
The Persian Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated the American advantage in a manner that stunned many abroad .
Although there are fewer fighters and bombers in the region than there were earlier this year , the Navy now has 250 to 300 cruise missiles , more than were used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 , officials said , speaking , as did others who discussed the subject , on the condition of anonymity .
The incident occurred just two days after Iraq declared it would fire on any aircraft flying in the `` no flight '' zones that the United States and its allies created over northern and southern Iraq after the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991 .
WASHINGTON _ The Army said Monday that it had no plans to reopen an investigation into an attack made at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 by soldiers under the command of Barry R. McCaffrey , the retired Army general who is now President Clinton 's drug-policy adviser .
The strategic reserve , established after Organization of Petroleum Export Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- oil embargoes in the early 1970s , has not been tapped since 1991 , during the Persian Gulf war .

Freedman , however , does not claim that her team 's number is `` final , '' and agrees that the universe might well turn out to be 13.5 billion years old , depending on what its total mass is .
A team of scientists led by an astronomer from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena , Calif. , has completed a survey of 800 stars called Cepheid Variables , and it indicates that the universe is probably between 12 billion and 13.5 billion years old .

Inventor Eli Whitney 's marvel , the cotton gin , was great for the American economy but , we learn , bad for the cause of black freedom .
In 1794 , Eli Whitney received a patent for his cotton gin , an invention that revolutionized America 's cotton industry .
There are biographical displays on America 's great gunsmiths _ Samuel Colt and Eliphalet Remington and Eli Whitney -LRB- who invented interchangeable gun parts as well as the cotton gin -RRB- , Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson .
Almost every work dealing with this sorrowful chapter in American history focuses on the antebellum South _ the years between Eli Whitney 's invention of the cotton gin in 1792 -LRB- which made slavery a much more important part of the nation 's economy -RRB- and the shots fired on Fort Sumter in 1861 , which marked the beginning of the Civil War .
Rich cotton planters _ their fortunes secure thanks to the cotton gin , invented by Eli Whitney , who had come to Savannah from Yale to teach on a cotton plantation _ built many of the ornate homes encircling the squares .
It was here , at Mulberry Grove Plantation , eight miles upstream from downtown Savannah , that Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793 .
They formed the Miller and Whitney Co. to market the cotton gin .
Athough history credits Whitney as the inventor of the cotton gin , neither he nor Miller derived any great financial return from the machine .
It was here , at Mulberry Grove Plantation , eight miles upstream from downtown Savannah , thatEli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793 .
Knowing that Whitney possessed impressive inventive and mechanical skills , Mrs. Greene told the others that he could make a machine to clean it _ and by April 1793 he had built the first cotton gin .
Other manufacturers , too , copied Whitney 's idea , so there was more than one early cotton gin .

A diary account claiming that Davy Crockett was captured and executed at the Battle of the Alamo -- contrary to Texas folklore -- seems to be authentic , one of the state 's leading archivists said Saturday .
The diary was written by Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la Pena , who served in Santa Anna 's army and fought at the Alamo during Texas ' war for independence .
Texas history buffs are worried that a Mexican officer 's myth-shattering account of Davy Crockett 's capture and execution after the battle of the Alamo may fall into the hands of a dreaded Yankee .
ALAMO-DIARY -LRB- Austin , Texas -RRB- _ The memoir of a Mexican army officer , which includes his eyewitness report on the battle of the Alamo and a controversial account of the death of legendary figure Davy Crockett , is being donated to the University of Texas .
`` Remember the Alamo '' became a battle cry used by Houston 's forces as they vanquished Santa Anna 's army at San Jacinto , thereby giving birth to a new nation _ the Republic of Texas .
After the Alamo battle , the struggle shifted to one of Texas independence .
Hispanics fought and died alongside Anglo defenders of the Alamo and later in the struggle for Texas independence .
Amelia W. Williams , a Texas history scholar and graduate student at the University of Texas , performed what once was regarded as the definitive research on who fought at the Alamo .
On Tuesday , Knopf will publish `` The Gates of the Alamo , '' a grandiose 577 -page novel of the Texas revolution that centers on the famous battle fought in San Antonio on March 6 , 1836 .
When Santa Anna was later defeated in the Battle of San Jacinto , thus liberating Texas from Mexico , the victorious Texas army famously shouted , `` Remember the Alamo ! ''

A similar spirit called mezcal that 's frequently confused with tequila can be made from any member of the agave family .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- The best tequilas are made from 100 percent blue agave , but all tequila falls into one of the following four categories .
In Mexico , anything made with 51 percent fermented from blue agave can be legally called tequila , but up to 49 percent may be fermented cane juice .
A great deal of the tequila going into margaritas is far from the best stuff and is rarely made with 100 percent agave .
Prices for most tequila brands have n't jumped at the U.S. retail level , but they might , especially for tequilas made by businesses that buy bulk agave on the open market .
A shortage of blue agave , the plant from which tequila is made , is causing the price increase .
Anybody who orders a margarita with a better tequila , made of 100 percent agave juice rather than the 51 percent required in the cheaper tequilas , will discover a smoother , more complex cocktail that cushions the salty , mineral agave flavor of the tequila with the orange sweetness of Triple Sec and the sweet-sour edge of lime juice .

Some critics have said it could be used to challenge the 1973 decision that legalized abortion .
The U.S. Supreme Court declared abortion constitutional in 1973 , but subsequent court decisions allowed states to regulate it .
Another reason for the declining number of abortion providers , according to abortion advocates , is that older doctors who were committed to the procedure in part because they experienced firsthand the days before abortion was legalized in 1973 , are now retiring .
In the narrowest light , his legacy was the landmark ruling he authored in 1973 that legalized a woman 's right to abortion in the United States .
Blackmun , author of the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide and set off one of the most explosive political debates in American history , died on Thursday at age 90 .
The groups ' ads and mailings also accused McCain of making '' conflicting statements '' about his stance on Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion .
