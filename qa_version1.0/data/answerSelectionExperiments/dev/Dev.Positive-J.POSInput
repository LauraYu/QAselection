NEW YORK _ As lead singer of Limp Bizkit , the band currently at the top of the Billboard album charts , Fred Durst has created a million-dollar persona by acting like the least likely to succeed .

And if someone such as Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst is commanding platinum record sales and sold-out concerts , is he adding something to hip-hop 's legacy or cashing in on it ?
Nor did the cameras show Heather Locklear standing as far away as possible from her co- presenter , the Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst , after he spontaneously cheered her breasts .

The disease , sporadic fatal insomnia , is caused by the same type of deformed proteins , known as prions , that cause mad cow disease and its human variant , Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease , according to two studies .
Prions are proteins with Jekyll-and-Hyde personalities that cluster in the brain .
The test , developed by private and government researchers , detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or TSE .
They would do this by using chimeraplasty to knock out the gene that makes proteins called prions in the sheep .
Unlike disease-causing viruses or bacteria , prions are normal proteins found throughout the body tissues of humans and other animals .

The Concorde , which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph , has been considered among the world 's safest planes .
By comparison , the Concorde , the fastest commercial aircraft , has a top speed of about 1,800 mph .
Someone who did better at high school algebra than I figured out that since the Concorde was moving at 1,330 mph , the ball traveled 8.5 miles , a world record .
The Concorde flies at some 55,000 feet , nearly twice ordinary passenger jets , and travels at nearly 1,350 miles per hour , twice the speed of sound .
And the plane 's extraordinary speed of 1,350 mph comes at a price : The Concorde is a gas guzzler .
The Concorde , which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some 60,000 feet above sea-level , has long been regarded by France as proof of its technological prowess .
For business executives , the advantage of the Concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .
