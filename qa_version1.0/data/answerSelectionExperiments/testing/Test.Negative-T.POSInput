Wicca -- sometimes spelled Wycca -- comes from the Old English word for witch .
Ms . Siefferly , a senior at the high school , has practiced Wicca for several years after reading a book on the subject , Schram said .
That 's because Ms . Palmer is a witch , the high priestess of a group that practices Wicca at Fort Hood with the knowledge and approval of the U.S . Army .
Such sentiments are rooted in fear and false notions that witches worship Satan or sacrifice animals , said David Oringderff , head of the San Antonio -based pagan group that sponsors Ms . Palmer 's Fort Hood Open Circle .
`` If they deny our right to worship ...
And so are an assortment of other young and middle-aged witches whose rising literary output of self-help titles and memoirs is propelled , in part , by a yearning for social acceptance and a growing demand for information about the highly individual , nature-based folk religion of Wicca , which worships ancient deities and , as one author put it , has suffered from `` centuries of bad press. ''
In the late 1980s , sales of Wicca titles averaged about 3,000 to 4,000 copies a year at Carol Publishing Group , but in the last two years sales have increased , with some of the popular titles selling up to 40,000 , said Steven Schragis , the publisher .
Wicca members tend to be white , college-educated , middle-class women , many of whom have families , said Ms . Berger , who said the religion was becoming more institutionalized as the members aged .
The fear of a backlash has never disappeared , said Ms . Berger , who added that the false stereotype that witches worship Satan endures .
`` When people think of Wicca , they think of either Satanism or silly mumbo jumbo. ''
`` I feel that ... he would pass a law that the military could not practice Wicca , and I 'm not willing to give up my rights of religious freedom , '' said Kiernan , who lived in Austin until 1993 while her husband , Michael , was stationed at nearby Fort Hood .

Its followers describe Wicca as a nature-based belief system that existed in Europe before Christianity .
Even so , why are a growing number of scholars studying followers of the occult ?

Referring to the general acceptance of Peplau 's interpersonal process , Sills added , `` It has been argued that Dr . Peplau 's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale . ''
BEIJING , June 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin , honorary chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society -LRB- CRCS -RRB- , today awarded Nightingale medals to three Chinese nurses -- Zeng Xiyuan , Wang Guiying and Qin Lijun .
He noted that 21 people from 12 countries , including the three Chinese nurses , won the 37th Nightingale Awards presented by the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The Nightingale Award , established at the Ninth International Red Cross Conference in Washington in 1912 , are presented every two years .

Amtrak is betting much of its future -- and that of high-speed rail in the United States -- on the premise that its soon-to-be-unveiled 150 mph trains will be competitive with airplanes and automobiles in the Boston - New York - Washington Northeast Corridor .
The long-awaited new trains , whose secret name and other vital statistics were being released at a news conference today , will start running in October along tracks that Amtrak currently uses .
By electrifying the entire 470-mile route , straightening curves and using 20 new trains sets that incorporate tilt technology , Amtrak figures to chop as much as 90 minutes off its 4 1/2-hour Boston -to- New York service and up to a half-hour off its current three-hour Washington -to- New York service .
As added incentives , the fare will be about 30 percent less than the current $ 199 walk-up air shuttle rate , and Amtrak will expand some of its current amenities , which include more spacious business-class seats , power outlets for computers , a dining car and full lavatories .
Amtrak views the Northeast Corridor as a model for other high-speed rail proposals in the Great Lakes , along the Southeast and Gulf Coast and throughout California and the Pacific Northwest .
In 1997 , Congress said Amtrak must become self-sufficient by 2002 .
Amtrak currently transports about 9 million people each year along the Northeast Corridor , some 7 million between New York and Washington and an additional 2 million between New York and Boston .
In recent years , Amtrak has spent millions improving the track and adding electrical service from New Haven to Boston .
While not as fast as the 185-mph TGV , the new Amtrak trains will glide around corners using technology that gently tilts the cars .
Twenty years after the last passenger train left Oklahoma , Amtrak rolled back into the state on Monday with daily service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth , Texas .
The result is a collaborative effort between the state and Amtrak , with Oklahoma leasing the track , trains and crew and Amtrak operating the train .
Oklahoma 's venture with Amtrak is n't unique .
Only five states are without Amtrak service -- Alaska , Hawaii , Maine , Wyoming and South Dakota .
Five years ago : Charges that Qubilah Shabazz , the daughter of Malcolm X , had plotted to murder Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan were dropped as jury selection for her trial was about to begin in Minneapolis .
Sen . John McCain panned a plan that would give Amtrak a '' multibillion-dollar blank check '' even though the railway is under orders to become independent from federal operating subsidies .
The Arizona Republican , chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , led a highly critical oversight hearing Tuesday that painted a sobering portrait of Amtrak 's financial status and outlook .
'' Amtrak is largely no better off today than one year ago , '' said Phyllis Scheinberg , associate director for transportation issues at the General Accounting Office .
Both Scheinberg and Kenneth Mead , inspector general in the Department of Transportation , said Amtrak is not on track to meet congressional demands that it achieve financial self-sufficiency by 2003 .
Amtrak could face liquidation if it fails to meet the deadline .
Mead forecasts that Amtrak will lose $ 1.4 billion more than it anticipates from 2000 through 2004 because rising costs are counteracting gains in riders and revenue .
It would let Amtrak issue bonds , sweetened by federal tax credits , to raise $ 10 billion over 10 years to build high-speed rail lines around the country .
Amtrak advocates say the money represents an investment in intercity rail that should be considered independent of Amtrak 's future as a corporation .
'' Amtrak needs to make more progress before any further funding schemes are enacted , '' he said .
Tuesday 's hearing was a dramatic departure from the last time Amtrak 's fate was considered by Commerce Committee members .
In February , a subcommittee led by Amtrak supporter Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , endorsed the railway 's plan to expand rather than cut service as the route to fiscal health .
But Hutchison and pro- Amtrak Democrats Max Cleland of Georgia and John Kerry of Massachusetts had to settle for supporting roles Tuesday as McCain offered an unflattering history lesson about Amtrak , which runs two routes that cross Arizona .
The promise , McCain said , was that Amtrak would be self-sufficient after two years of federal operating subsidies .
Amtrak is now in its 29th year of subsidies and has consumed more than $ 23 billion in federal operating support .
'' I am now embarrassed to admit that I worked to create Amtrak , '' Joseph Vranich , a former Amtrak spokesman turned critic , told the committee .
Congress gave Amtrak in 1997 an infusion of aid along with a 2003 deadline to become self-sufficient .
Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson , Wisconsin 's governor , told the committee the railway will meet the deadline .
He said Amtrak 's governing board met last week and addressed much of the criticism in Mead 's audit .
'' For much of Amtrak 's history , it was not run like a business , '' Thompson said .
'' It did not have an entrepreneurial focus .
It did lack a serious business plan .
But in recent years we have made remarkable progress in turning Amtrak around. ''
Thompson , Mead and Scheinberg agreed that , even if Amtrak weans itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003 , it will need significant continuing federal support for capital expenses like track repair .
Amtrak President George Warrington told the committee that the railway expects delivery next week of the first of 20 high-speed trains for the Boston -to- Washington Northeast Corridor .
The long-delayed Acela Express service , which will reach speeds of 150 mph , will begin running '' within a month , '' Warrington said .

Amtrak is offering a deal it hopes few travelers can resist : Get good service or a free ride .
Amtrak , which must wean itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003 , hopes its planned service improvements -- such as flowers in bathrooms and entertainment for children -- will boost revenues by $ 85 million over three years .
Central to winning customers ' confidence is Amtrak 's new pledge : Amtrak will offer dissatisfied passengers a refund voucher good for future travel .
Amtrak spokesman John Wolf estimated that only one out of every 1,000 passengers will request a refund voucher .
Amtrak is offering vouchers , instead of refunds on the current trip , to give itself a second chance to woo the customer .
Amtrak still faces hurdles , such as limited routes and schedules , in becoming a true alternative to airlines .
Earlier this year , Amtrak announced a high-speed service to lure travelers who now fly the lucrative Washington - New York - Boston shuttle route .
Amtrak also is developing other high-speed rail corridors elsewhere , including one linking Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska , Ohio , and Wisconsin .
Amtrak passenger revenues exceeded $ 1 billion for the first time ever last year , with 21 million customers riding by rail .
Amtrak said it had the best on-time performance in 13 years .
Moscow is insisting on a separate sector for its peacekeepers ; NATO says that wo n't happen though President Clinton predicted a `` successful conclusion. ''
Amtrak : Good Service or Free Travel
Amtrak , wooing people to take the train , not the plane , today promised all passengers good service or a voucher for a free ride .
Amtrak has agreed to settle a race discrimination lawsuit filed by black management employees and applicants for management positions .
Under terms of the settlement , Amtrak did not admit to any wrongdoing , but agreed to extensive changes in corporate practices designed to prevent race discrimination .
Michael Lieder , lead counsel for the plaintiffs , said that the new practices `` will help employees of all races survive and thrive at Amtrak well into the future. ''
In addition , Amtrak has created a new position , vice president of business diversity and strategic initiatives , and filled the job .
The lawsuit , filed last August in the U.S . District Court for the District of Columbia , contended Amtrak discriminated against blacks in filling management jobs and handling pay , promotion and disciplinary issues .
It also alleged Amtrak maintained a racially hostile work environment .
For the second time in nine months , Amtrak has settled a racial discrimination suit , the latest alleging the national railway condoned hostile work conditions for blacks that created a '' segregated work force . ''
Amtrak did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement announced on Friday , but the railway agreed to change company policies .
And the settlement , which must be approved by a federal judge , sets up a $ 16 million fund to provide economic relief to 800 to 1,000 black employees who suffered discrimination since 1995 and as many as 4,000 black job applicants Amtrak turned away .
The suit was filed by 13 black members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees who build and maintain railroad tracks for Amtrak 's engineering department in the Northeast corridor between Washington and Boston .
'' Amtrak is committed to a cultural change at the company that will not only make Amtrak a better place in which to work , but also will enable us to be more responsive to the diverse marketplace we serve , '' he said .
Amtrak has agreed to change policies affecting hiring , certification , discipline , training and advancement and computerize personnel files and applications , said Maia Caplan , a Washington attorney for employees who filed the federal class action suit in April 1998 .
'' There 's a lot that Amtrak has agreed to here that would not have happened if this had gone into litigation , '' she said .
The agreement settles the first of three discrimination suits filed against Amtrak in the past two years .
In July 1999 , Amtrak settled a suit filed by black managers and employees seeking management positions .
The remaining suit , which has not been resolved , was filed in November 1999 by 24 current and former workers who allege that Amtrak 's Intercity Strategic Business Unit , which operates in 29 states , discriminates against black workers .
Sen . John McCain panned a plan that would give Amtrak a '' multibillion-dollar blank check '' even though the railway is under orders to become independent from federal operating subsidies .
The Arizona Republican , chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , led a highly critical oversight hearing Tuesday that painted a sobering portrait of Amtrak 's financial status and outlook .

But Hutchison and pro- Amtrak Democrats Max Cleland of Georgia and John Kerry of Massachusetts had to settle for supporting roles Tuesday as McCain offered an unflattering history lesson about Amtrak , which runs two routes that cross Arizona .
Congress created Amtrak in 1971 from a collection of failing passenger railroads .
The promise , McCain said , was that Amtrak would be self-sufficient after two years of federal operating subsidies .
Amtrak is now in its 29th year of subsidies and has consumed more than $ 23 billion in federal operating support .

WASHINGTON _ Amtrak managers filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday alleging that the company discriminated against African-Americans in management and other white-collar positions .
The 13 plaintiffs _ who also include former managers , job applicants , and one white former employee _ said Amtrak has paid black managers and professionals less than whites , has not promoted or hired blacks fairly , has condoned the use of racial epithets , and has retaliated against those who have filed complaints .
The lawsuit is the second discrimination charge against Amtrak this year in US District Court in Washington .
Black track-laying and repair workers in the Northeast filed a class-action suit in April , also charging unfair treatment of blacks and likening Amtrak to a `` plantation . ''
The plaintiffs ' lawyers said they want Amtrak to change its employment and disciplinary practices , and they are seeking damages for back pay and mental anguish .
In response to the allegations , Amtrak officials said Thursday the company works to prevent discrimination .
`` Amtrak has a zero -tolerance policy for discriminatory practices in hiring or in any aspect of the workplace , '' said George D . Warrington , Amtrak 's acting president and chief executive officer .
The earlier lawsuit , which included two Amtrak workers from Massachusetts , opened the door for the second suit , lawyers said .
`` After we filed that complaint , we received a flood of calls from Amtrak employees that led us to believe that the extent of racial discrimination is much broader than the first lawsuit , '' said Michael Leider , a lawyer representing the plaintiffs .
Roberta Perry , a former manager at Amtrak in Philadelphia , complained that she was not allowed to advance at the company , and she said the company did little to stop co-workers who use racial epithets , even after she filed complaints .
The white female plaintiff , Leslie Dunning of Fairfax Station , Va . , said Amtrak demoted her in retaliation for helping a black manager prepare a report that detailed discrimination within the company .
WASHINGTON _ Amtrak said Wednesday that to balance its books before Congress eliminates its operating subsidies , it would haul fruits and vegetables cross-country , United Parcel Service packages across the Southwest , express packages on Metroliners between New York and Washington , and more U.S . mail all over the nation .
In a conference call with reporters to discuss the company 's plans , Warrington said that before Congress created Amtrak a quarter-century ago , nearly half of railroads ' passenger -train revenue actually came from hauling freight .
In adding freight cars now to its regular passenger runs , he said , Amtrak will not allow any compromise in speed or reliability .
But independent experts said the relatively little freight that Amtrak already carries had delayed some of its trains , including the Southwest Chief , which makes a daily run between Chicago and Los Angeles and which , Amtrak said Wednesday , will carry UPS packages from Kansas City , Mo . , to Albuquerque , N.M .
`` They 've already added so much time to the schedule of the Chief , '' said Ross Capon , executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers , `` and already had so many horror stories. ''
Daniel L . Biggs , general chairman of the Transportation Communications Union 's Amtrak division , which represents a variety of the railroad 's workers , said that he had misgivings but that `` basically if you point a gun at Amtrak and say , `You 're supposed to be operationally self-sufficient by the end of 2002 , ' it 's not at all surprising they are looking for revenue streams such as have been traditionally associated with passenger trains . ''
Analysts said they thought Amtrak could find a substantial niche in carrying high-value freight .
Amtrak also said Wednesday that it would close its food warehouses and hire Dobbs International Services , which already provides food to airlines , to do the same with trains .
As a result of the arrangement with Dobbs , a subsidiary of Viad Corp . , about 300 Amtrak workers will be absorbed into other jobs or take buyouts averaging $ 35,000 each , about a year 's pay , said Biggs , the union official .
NEW YORK _ Aiming to bring high-speed rail service to Boston by the start of the new millennium , Amtrak said Tuesday that it would start rolling out the first of its new 150 mile -an-hour trains by December .
But more important for Amtrak , the high-speed train provides a model for its rail service across the nation , and is the centerpiece of its hopes of economic redemption after operating for three decades with government subsidies .
`` Today we are kicking off the revitalization of train service in America , '' Gov . Tommy G . Thompson of Wisconsin , who is the chairman of Amtrak 's board , said at a Manhattan news conference .
`` We are giving notice to our competitors , '' said George D . Warrington , the president of Amtrak , the National Railroad Passenger Corp . , addressing the more mundane , unresolved question of whether trains _ even those making the New York -to- Washington run in two and a half hours _ can compete with discount regional airlines .
With new , electrified engines pulling rebuilt Amtrak cars , the three-hour schedule has been made possible by extensive track work and electrification from New Haven to Boston , a project that cost $ 1.6 billion .
With the new trains , the trip from Manhattan to Washington will take a half-hour shorter than the current three-hour trip of Amtrak 's Metroliner express train , which went into service in 1969 after track upgrades and has a top speed of 125 miles an hour .
Officials of Amtrak refused to say what they would charge for the high-speed rail trip .
Amtrak 's ticket pricing for high-speed trains could be crucial to its success .
`` The market they have to go after is the business traveler who at the moment would n't consider Amtrak unless he is just somebody who does n't like to fly , '' said Jeffrey Zupan , a transportation analyst for the Regional Plan Association in New York .
To attract more riders , Amtrak said it would schedule more trains along the length of its Northeast corridor , with the biggest service expansion between Boston and New York City .
Another question left unanswered Tuesday was how many stops the high-speed trains would make , another complex equation for Amtrak planners , since every stop increases travel time for those on board .
Preliminary plans by Amtrak that were released yesterday call for stops of its high-speed express service in Boston , Providence , R.I . ,
`` Obviously , not every train is going to stop at every station , and we are going to have to look at what makes most sense in consideration of speed and convenience , '' said Barbara J . Richardson , Amtrak 's executive vice president .
With such questions remaining until sometime later this year , Amtrak officials sought Tuesday to emphasize several improvements in comfort and service that are planned for the new trains , largely aimed at to business travelers in an era of cellular phones , laptop computers and increased demands for executive productivity , even on the road .
Amtrak plans to name the trains Acela -LRB- pronounced uh-SELL-uh -RRB- , which is a made-up name , not an acronym .
David Neeleman , the company 's chief executive , said recently that the airline will operate as Jetblue Airways .
Amtrak Is Rolling Out Satisfaction Express
Amtrak plans to put a customer-satisfaction guarantee into effect by the end of the year .
Amtrak said its new hiring would focus on people with traits that met customer-service needs .
Trains that do n't pass muster wo n't be permitted to leave , said John Wolf , an Amtrak spokesman .
WASHINGTON _ Amtrak 's new 150-mph express train , which was supposed to begin service between Washington and Boston this year , will be delayed several months because the wheels on the passenger coaches vibrate at high speeds and are wearing out too quickly , the railroad said Wednesday .
Amtrak is counting on the new service , called Acela , to lure business away from the airlines and to generate $ 180 million a year in profits .
But he said Amtrak would make ends meet with new revenue , most of which is derived from one-time deals .
Amtrak said it would know in 60 days when the trains would be ready .
Warrington and the president of Bombardier , Jacques Lapare , were not specific about the cause of the problem , but Lapare said that it became apparent only because of instrumentation on a test train at Pueblo .
Amtrak is also upgrading the tracks between Washington and Boston , said Warrington , which should lead to improved service even before the high-speed trains are introduced .
WASHINGTON _ Amtrak 's ridership in July hit a 10-year high and the total number of passengers for the year is poised to set a record , railroad officials said on Wednesday , crediting extensive investments to improve reliability and service .
Amtrak will lose money again this year , but will meet the congressional deadline of weaning itself from operating subsidies by the fiscal year ending Sept . 30 , 2002 , officials said .
Amtrak ridership statistics go back to 1975 .

In his author 's note , he points out that the subject of his book , Jack Welch , chairman of General Electric Co . , refused to cooperate with the project .
`` At Any Cost '' is actually a remarkably one-sided book about Welch 's tenure at GE .
O'Boyle has made Welch the poster boy for modern capitalism and all the ills that accompany it : downsizing , deal-making , ethical violations , pollution .
If the book had come out a few months later , O'Boyle probably would have blamed Welch for the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the ruble .
Welch rolled up his sleeves and went to work .
Welch did n't invent the forces of modern capitalism .
Bill Gates may be America 's best known corporate leader , but in business circles , Jack Welch is probably more admired .
Welch has created winners in at least half a dozen separate fields .
He dismisses Welch 's foray into finance _ probably his greatest triumph _ in a few paragraphs .
The author has practically nothing to say about GE 's accomplishments in aircraft engines or medical devices because they do n't fit his central thesis : that under Welch , GE has abandoned all research , technology , and manufacturing .
O'Boyle has plenty to say about the problems of the Welch years .
More than 100,000 GE jobs have been axed under Welch , in a series of downsizings that have devastated old industrial towns like Pittsfield and Schenectady , N.Y . Did Welch need to be so hard-nosed ?
It is also fair to ask how much blame Welch should bear for some of the ethical lapses that have happened on his watch , especially in the defense business .
While Welch has never told his employees to break the law , the high-pressure culture he has created may have encouraged some of his underlings to cross the line in pursuit of greater profits .
In the business press , Jack Welch receives very different treatment .
Someday , a book will come along that provides a balanced account of Jack Welch .
Nor did anyone at the LTV Corp . question Peter E . Kelly about the marketing potential of the Internet when he was named president of the company in 1991 and became a front-runner for the top job .
`` Now that E- commerce has joined quality , globalization and services as a companywide initiative , it 's a good bet that the next CEO will be savvy about the Internet , '' said Bruce Bunch , a spokesman for GE , which is bracing for Welch 's retirement in December 2000 .
`` Even if they do n't specify Internet savvy by name , they are asking for it , '' said Gerard R . Roche , chairman of Heidrick & Struggles , a search firm .
`` The Internet is such a new phenomenon that it would be too limiting to mandate hands-on experience , '' said Thomas J . Neff , chairman of U.S . operations for the search firm Spencer Stuart .
Similarly , Jeffrey E . Christian , chairman of the executive -recruiting firm Christian & Timbers , expects the proportion of non-Internet companies demanding Internet expertise to grow from 30 percent today to 60 percent in just six months and to 100 percent three years from now .
That worries Kelly , 57 , who became chairman of LTV in February .
Everyone knew it was coming , but now they know when : John F . Welch Jr . , the chairman of General Electric , will retire after the company 's annual meeting in April 2001 .
Welch , who announced the date on CNBC on Monday evening , will turn 65 on Nov . 19 , 2000 , and had always indicated he would step down then .
`` Jack still plans to announce his successor in mid-2000 , so this is business as usual for us , '' said Beth Comstock , a GE spokeswoman .
In a sense , Welch will be both a difficult and an easy act to follow .
Corporate wags have long referred to GE as `` the House that Jack built. ''
He whittled away at GE 's bloated staff long before downsizing became a buzzword , earning him the rubric of Neutron Jack _ someone who kills off the people but leaves the physical assets intact .
Welch has also turned GE into what he calls a `` boundary-less '' organization , a place where executives are rewarded for sharing insights and customer contacts and castigated for keeping good ideas to themselves .
Only people whom Welch deemed to be team players were propelled up the ranks .
`` The businesses have a momentum in market share and profitability that will persist when Jack is retired , '' said Russell A . Leavitt , an analyst at Banc of America Securities .
`` And Jack will personally introduce him to the major customers . ''
Welch has made it clear in the past that whoever succeeds him will have demonstrated proficiency in globalization , in moving the revenue stream from manufacturing to services , and in employing Six Sigma , a complex system that uses statistical analyses to all but eliminate defects in products and processes .
Welch has often said he thinks chief executives should stay for 10 , even 20 years , to live with the results of their long-term decisions .
At 43 , Immelt could conceivably serve as long as Welch has .
</A>
<A 35.2 >
So fervent a proselytizer is Welch that GE has spent three years and more than $ 1 billion to convert all of its divisions to the Six Sigma faith .
The GE Medical Systems unit recently introduced a $ 1.25 million diagnostic scanner , the first product that GE designed from start to finish using Six Sigma principles .
Six Sigma teamwork enabled GE Plastics to produce 1.1 billion pounds more plastics without building one new plant .
In the case of the new GE Medical Systems product _ a superfast diagnostic scanner called the Lightspeed _ 200 people spent nearly three years and almost $ 50 million to run 250 separate Six Sigma analyses .
GE Medical Systems , which already controls 39 percent of the $ 1.6 billion global market for scanners , has high hopes for the Lightspeed .
But Six Sigma enabled GE Medical to anticipate which compromises doctors would accept .
`` Six Sigma let us predict the amount of variability that customers will tolerate before they perceive it as a defect , '' said Marc Onetto , who oversees Six Sigma projects at Gems , as GE Medical Systems is commonly known .
The old tubes , which cost $ 59,000 each to replace , had long been a thorn in GE 's side .

<A 35.3 >
GE - WELCH-ROLE Looking at Welch 's role as a model for chief executives everywhere .
Welch became GE 's chief executive in April 1981 , so the date will mark his 20th anniversary .
`` Jack still plans to announce his successor in mid-2000 , so this is business as usual for us , '' said Beth Comstock , a GE spokeswoman .
Corporate wags have long referred to GE as `` the House that Jack built. ''
He whittled away at GE 's bloated staff long before downsizing became a buzzword , earning him the rubric of Neutron Jack _ someone who kills off the people but leaves the physical assets intact .
He divested all businesses in which GE was not dominant _ a strategy that has been adopted by numerous American companies .
He is pushing all of GE 's divisions into e-commerce with such fervor that many analysts say that GE will soon be the most Internet-savvy of the non-dot- com companies .
Welch has also turned GE into what he calls a `` boundary-less '' organization , a place where executives are rewarded for sharing insights and customer contacts and castigated for keeping good ideas to themselves .
`` He turned GE away from the idea of supreme rulers and introduced it to team structures , '' said Nicholas P . Heymann , an analyst with Prudential Securities .
But who , in fact , will be the next No . 1 at GE ?
Gary M . Reiner , 45 , GE 's chief information officer , has led many of the company 's initial forays onto the Web .
David L . Calhoun , 42 , the new head of GE Capital , GE 's biggest and most profitable unit , is often cited as a dark horse candidate .
Still , although no one will say so for the record , the odds-on favorite is Jeffrey R . Immelt , head of GE Medical Systems .
He was the first GE executive to use Six Sigma not only to refine processes but to design a product .
Shares of GE have ridden a roller coaster over the last week .
GE fell 93.75 cents Tuesday , to $ 128.4375 .
`` A strong quarter is business as usual for GE , but this quarter was even better than normal , '' said Charles Hill , director of research at First Call .
Investors seemed unimpressed as shares of GE , based in Fairfield , Conn . , fell $ 1 , to $ 52.50 .
`` Most industrial companies are experiencing no more than 5 percent organic growth , so GE 's results are just phenomenal , '' said Jeffrey Sprague , an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney .
The numbers did little to help handicap the race to succeed Jack Welch , the GE chairman , who will retire next year .
Analysts expect the heir to be one of three executives : Robert Nardelli , head of GE Power Systems ; Jeffrey Immelt , head of GE Medical Systems ; or W . James McNerney Jr . , head of GE Aircraft Engines .
GE Power Systems had a particularly robust quarter , with sales up 60 percent .
All makers of turbines had growth spurts as utilities continued their buying spree , but analysts say that GE grabbed share away from competitors like ABB and Siemens .
GE Medical nearly doubled its sales of X-ray machines , while sales of CAT scanners and ultrasound machines were up more than 35 percent .
Thanks to robust sales of high-margin services , GE Aircraft Engines saw its profit rise 20 percent on a revenue increase of just 4 percent .
Even without new reality or game shows , GE 's television network , NBC , held onto a high share of viewers aged 18 to 49 _ the ones advertisers pay most to reach .
Earnings at GE Capital , meanwhile , were up 17 percent on a revenue rise of 23 percent .
Analysts expect those earnings to rise even higher as GE Capital continues to de-emphasize businesses like the leasing of rail cars in favor of those featuring financial services .
GE , never short of cash , will soon have even more .
GE owns part of PaineWebber and should reap $ 1.4 billion from the deal .
Gary Sheffer , a GE spokesman , insists that GE was not consulted on the merger and has not yet made plans for the money .
GE , in fact , bought back $ 523 million in stock during the quarter .
Robert Wright , the longtime chief of broadcasting giant NBC , will take the post of vice chairman of the board for General Electric -LRB- GE : NYSE -RRB- , the television network 's parent , GE , announced on Friday .
Wright , 57 , will continue at NBC 's helm , a seat he has occupied for nearly 14 years , and will be responsible for overseeing GE 's media interest in his new role , the company said .
`` Bob 's a visionary with a great strategic mind , and he 's a strong business leader with outstanding people skills , '' GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said in a statement .
In the future , analyst Lawrence Horan said , NBC could play an increasingly vital role as GE puts an added emphasis on the communications and information fields .
GE 's decision to broaden Wright 's influence , he added , reflects that commitment .
Shares of GE were down 1 3/8 , or 3 percent , to 51 1/8 in afternoon trading .

`` At Any Cost '' is actually a remarkably one-sided book about Welch 's tenure at GE .
When Jack Welch took over GE in 1981 , he inherited a slow-moving , bureaucratic company .
At the same time he moved GE into service businesses like entertainment and finance that promised greater growth and higher returns .
Welch did n't invent the forces of modern capitalism .
Between 1982 and 1997 GE 's stock price rose 1,155 percent .
The author has practically nothing to say about GE 's accomplishments in aircraft engines or medical devices because they do n't fit his central thesis : that under Welch , GE has abandoned all research , technology , and manufacturing .
He calls the failure of a new GE refrigerator in the 1980s `` one of the greatest fiascoes in modern engineering. ''
The author spends a full 50 pages describing the government 's attempt to prosecute GE for price fixing in the industrial diamond business .
Could the transformation of GE have been accomplished in a more humane way ?
In his 20 years as GE 's chief executive officer , Welch has generated enormous wealth not only for the company 's stockholders but for hundreds of companies that do business with GE .
People are not going to buy it for its plot , character development or sex appeal .
Unlike Chrysler 's Lee Iacocca , whose story sold an astonishing 2.6 million hardcover books , Welch did not rescue a large American company from bankruptcy , nor does he have Iacocca 's promotional flair .
People will buy Welch 's book because it will be marketed as the definitive text of modern American business practices .
But a lot of people think he has all the answers , and Time Warner is betting that that there are at least 1.6 million people willing to pay good money to find out what they are .
GE was famous for , even admired for its layers of sector managers , department managers , unit managers and supervisors , all of whom were thought to be essential to strategic planning and quality control .
Neutron Jack threw some ordnance at this system , and when the dust cleared he had eliminated all but four of nine hierarchical levels _ and , more important , made sure that the bosses of each of GE 's various businesses reported directly to him .
Freed of fuzzy paternalism , the people who remained were encouraged to think for themselves and question the corporate culture , resulting not only in technological innovation but in huge cost savings .

Responding to tart criticism of this relationship by Hun Sen , Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand said Sunday that Cambodia was trying to `` pass the buck '' to Thailand and to divert attention from its own difficulties regarding the handling of Khmer Rouge defectors .
But he appears to have been stung by reminders in the press that he lent his name to the movement , as its nominal head of state , at the start of the period from 1975 to 1979 when it ruled Cambodia and caused the deaths of more than a million of his subjects .
Cambodia objected to a foreign panel of judges , arguing that this kind of tribunal would violate the country 's sovereign powers , and the national parliament effectively vetoed the idea .
Ieng Sary , who did not take sides in Cambodia 's recent political turmoil , arrived here on Tuesday for the first time since the Khmer Rouge was driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion in early 1979 .
Cambodian leader Hun Sen says that upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993 monitored by the United Nations , thanks largely to the collapse of the Khmer Rouge .
The Khmer Rouge , who caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979 , remained a potent guerrilla force in 1993 and boycotted the polls , threatening to kill Cambodians who voted .
Hun Sen said that the government will place 70,000 soldiers and civilians at the disposal of the National Electoral Commission , the body overseeing the polls , to ensure a stable election environment .
The Cambodian government 's decision to welcome back into the fold five important leaders of the dying Khmer Rouge rebel movement smacked of hypocrisy , ousted co- premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Saturday .
Hun Sen , the country 's strongman , last week welcomed the defecting members of the rebel movement 's inner circle , including former deputy premier Chan Youran , after they agreed to cut ties with their old comrades and to give up their fight against the government .
But his actions were not treated as a victory heralding the end of the guerrilla movement , as Hun Sen 's recently have been .
A trio of veteran rebel leaders , including Khieu Samphan , still remains in the jungle , along with perhaps several hundred followers while smaller bands of Khmer Rouge roam remote areas of the country .
Any trial of surviving Khmer Rouge leaders implicated in genocide and other crimes against humanity should take place on Cambodian soil , Prime Minister Hun Sen said in an interview published Thursday .
Doubtful that Khmer Rouge military chief Ta Mok and other surviving rebels could be apprehended , the prime minister suggested a Cambodian trial instead .
Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died of an apparent heart attack in April , but a trio of important leader _ Ta Mok , Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ are still at large with a dwindling band of armed supporters in the rugged mountains along the Thai-Cambodian border .
The rebel 's historically close relationship with the Thai military and the reintegration of several top Khmer Rouge _ also possible defendants _ into the Cambodian government are seen as a potential stumbling blocks to a trial .
Ieng Sary , a deputy prime minister in the Khmer Rouge regime , received an amnesty from the government in 1996 in exchange for leading a mass defection of rebel fighters that crippled the movement .
Any trial of Khmer Rouge defectors who may soon face charges of crimes against humanity may expose the roles of the United States and China in the movement 's brutal rise to power , an aide to one defector said .
Earlier today , Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea , members of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot 's inner circle during the group 's brutal 1975-79 rule , must be tried for genocide .
Manuel Jota did not say how many of the 14 people aboard had survived , and the report could not be independently confirmed , but he did say captured rebels had told the army they shot down the plane , and that an unknown number of survivors were being held at rebel bases in Angola 's highlands .
Fernando Henrique Cardoso became Brazil 's first re-elected president today , vowing to continue modernizing the economy while battling the country 's deep social inequality .
He is the first Brazilian president to take advantage of a 1997 constitutional change allowing the head of state to serve a second term .
Leader Confident on Khmer Rouge Case
The tour has been offered to previous defectors , in part to try to disabuse them of the continuing belief among many Khmer Rouge that the country is still under the thumb of its neighbor , Vietnam , and that Cambodians are ready to rise up in the Khmer Rouge 's support .
Many people in public life today _ including Prime Minister Hun Sen _ have had links with the Khmer Rouge , either while they ruled the country or in the next decade when a coalition of royalists , democrats and Khmer Rouge forces battled a Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh .
In addition to the political cross-currents that complicate a resolution to the country 's past conflicts , there is a network of often-hidden personal relationships that keeps past debts and rivalries alive .
Among these are Khieu Samphan , the movement 's nominal head of state , and Nuon Chea , a top ideologist , who both surrendered to the government on Dec . 25 .
Hun Sen was a middle-ranking Khmer Rouge field commander until he broke with the movement in 1977 , but most historians say he does not appear to have been involved in Khmer Rouge atrocities , and he appears to face little threat from a tribunal focusing on those years .
WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration , working to insure that two top Khmer Rouge defectors are put on trial for their roles in the deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians in the 1970s , is quietly trying to organize an international tribunal under U.N . auspices that would not be opposed by China and the current Cambodian government .
The officials said they hoped that such a plan would placate Beijing , which was a steadfast supporter of the Maoist -inspired movement from the 1960s until the early 1990s , when a U.N . peace agreement ended virtually all foreign support for the Khmer Rouge .
The Vietnamese discovered the archival records of the Khmer Rouge bureaucracy that disclosed the systematic torture and killing of Cambodians as well as the killing fields that held the remains of the victims .
Along with Pol Pot , they oversaw the Khmer Rouge and their reign of terror , during which at least 1 million Cambodians are estimated to have been executed or to have died of starvation , disease and overwork .
The king , who has close ties to the Chinese government and is undergoing medical treatment in Beijing , headed the country for more than two decades .
In the past the Cambodian leader , Hun Sen , has favored prosecuting Khmer Rouge leaders , whose regime in the late 1970s killed more than 1 million people .
`` We believe that what we are doing now is in conformity with the convention on prevention and punishment of genocide , '' Hong said in a later interview , pointing to the convention 's article that allows for a `` competent tribunal '' to be convened in the country where the crimes occurred .
The minister also announced that his government has rejected the recommendation that a truth commission be convened to try lesser figures in the Khmer Rouge movement .
In a series of coordinated steps , the Cambodian government first captured Ta Mok , the last fugitive senior Khmer Rouge figure , announced that he would be tried in a military court in Phnom Penh , and then dispatched the foreign minister to the United Nations to head off the building movement for an tribunal before the release of the U.N . report .
Behind his country 's determination to hold the Khmer Rouge trial in Cambodian courts , Hor Nam Hong said , is the lingering anger over the international community 's refusal to punish the Khmer Rouge when they were overthrown by the Vietnamese in 1979 and throughout the 1980s .
However , the Khmer Rouge refused to comply with the 1992 U.N . peacekeeping effort created by the 1991 accords , and it was only with the capture of Ta Mok last week that the government put an end to what remained of the Khmer Rouge movement .
Nuon Chea , his second-in-command , surrendered in December with a fellow Khmer Rouge leader , Khieu Samphan , to the Cambodian government .
In his 1997 letter requesting the aid of the United Nations in setting up a tribunal , Hun Sen said his country did not have the `` resources or the expertise '' to conduct a trial .
UNITED NATIONS _ Hoping to break a deadlock between the Cambodian government and the United Nations over how to bring former Khmer Rouge leaders to trial for war crimes , the United States has proposed the outlines of a compromise plan , an American official said Tuesday .
A number of former Khmer Rouge officials from the movement that devastated the country from 1975 to early 1979 are now in government or other influential positions .
The United States , which has been pressing for several years for war crimes hearings and possibly genocide trials for Khmer Rouge leaders , many of whom have died or been killed , is trying to save the U.N . plan as a starting point for more negotiations with the Cambodians , a senior American official said Tuesday .
Under a radical form of communist revolution , more than a million Cambodians died in purges , of overwork or disease , as the movement 's leaders tried to completely restructure Cambodian society and rid it of a middle class .
PHNOM PENH , October 29 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen held talks earlier today with former Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary , but the details of the talks were not disclosed .
The meeting took place at Hun Sen 's suburban villa .
The surrender took place Friday and Khieu Samphan has moved to the western town of Pailin under the government troops .
PHNOM PENH , March 4 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen asked U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan Wednesday to caution to decide a tribunal of Khmer Rouge leaders , warning it could cause panic and war if not properly conducted .
Speaking to the press , Eckhard said no date had been set for the visit by the chief legal counsel , Hans Corell and it would take place when a mutually convenient time can be agreed upon .

The faces of Pol Pot , Nuon Chea and Ta Mok were hardly known to the world during the Khmer Rouge 's secretive , bloody reign of terror from 1975 to 1979 , when as many as 2 million Cambodians perished .
Cambodian leader Hun Sen says that upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993 monitored by the United Nations , thanks largely to the collapse of the Khmer Rouge .
In an interview seen Tuesday in his monthly Cambodia New Vision bulletin , Hun Sen said that security had greatly improved in the past five years despite tensions that led to a bloody power struggle with Prince Norodom Ranariddh last year .
`` In 1993 , Khmer Rouge occupied many places ... , ''
Cambodia 's King Norodom Sihanouk granted an audience Wednesday to Ieng Sary , a former high-ranking Khmer Rouge leader who was his jailer in the late 1970s .
A palace source , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the king cordially received Ieng Sary , whom he reluctantly pardoned in 1996 to ensure the breakup of the Khmer Rouge , for an hour at his palace in the northwestern town of Siem Reap .
Ieng Sary oversaw the house arrest of the king during the Khmer Rouge 's genocidal rule .
In the past , Sihanouk has called Ieng Sary a `` psychopath '' and shown contempt for his uncouth manner and failure to show respect when Sihanouk was a nominal ally of the Khmer Rouge in the early 1970s before he became their prisoner .
Ieng Sary , for his part , has described how the guerrillas used an alliance with Sihanouk to help win power , once likening him to a `` water buffalo who will help us cross the river. ''
At least 14 of the king 's relatives and children died under Khmer Rouge rule .
It was a political deal undertaken to ensure the eventual defection of some 10,000 war-weary Khmer Rouge guerrillas to the government .
The defections marked the beginning of the end for the Khmer Rouge , which is now down to a few hundred guerrillas along the Thai border .
His death has spurred new calls by human-rights groups and some Western governments , led by the United States , for the trial of remaining Khmer Rouge leaders .
Sihanouk was toppled by a U.S . -backed coup in 1970 and lent his support to the Khmer Rouge , then a small band of jungle guerrillas , against the new government .
The Khmer Rouge regime , however , proved every bit as rabidly anti-Vietnamese as Lon Nol , and their old allies responded to repeated border attacks by toppling the Khmer Rouge in 1979 .
Hun Sen , a mid-ranking Khmer Rouge commander who defected to escape purges , rose to the top of the Hanoi -installed government in 1985 and has been Cambodia 's most powerful figure ever since .
The irony is that he was a leading member of the ousted Khmer Rouge , which did n't permit free elections during its five-year reign of terror .
Chan Youran served as the Khmer Rouge ambassador to many countries , including China , where the creed of cultural revolution originated .
As many as 2 million Cambodians were executed or died from starvation , forced labor and illness before a Vietnamese invasion toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979 .
He and other so-called revolutionaries will avail themselves of the vote in Pailin , the Khmer Rouge bastion that became one of the first major outposts to end years of guerrilla warfare and make peace with the Cambodian government in 1996 .
Their defections came after the Khmer Rouge stronghold in Anlong Veng was overrun by government troops in April and they advocated ending the war .
The defeat was accompanied by the death of Pol Pot , infamous leader of the Khmer Rouge regime , of a purported heart attack , after he was ousted in a bloody purge last year by Tak Mok , known as `` the butcher . ''
The defectors were greeted with open arms by the government of strongman Hun Sen , who has spent years denouncing the Khmer Rouge but found that the best way of beating them was to let them join .
`` We are happy to take part in the elections , '' said Kor Bun Heng , the former senior spokesman for the Khmer Rouge .
The Khmer Rouge agreed to , then boycotted , U.N.-sponsored elections five years ago .
When asked why it took so long to come around , Chan Youran asked the age of his Cambodian interviewer .
Cambodian leader Hun Sen said Saturday that a former Khmer Rouge general wanted for the abduction and murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has been arrested and will stand trial in Phnom Penh .
Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a train in 1994 and abducted three young Western tourists : David Wilson of Australia , Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet of France .
Pailin is a former Khmer Rouge stronghold on Cambodia 's western border .
Sim Theng , a former Khmer Rouge division commander , told The Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and attempted to defect among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have laid down their arms since August , 1996 .
The defections , initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure Ieng Sary , crippled the revolutionary movement and have given the country its best chance for peace in decades .
At least 10 foreigners have been taken hostage and subsequently killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas since 1994 .
While it is possible there are some tiny bands of guerrillas still wandering the jungles , Thayer said he knew of no sizeable Khmer Rouge fighting force that could pose a viable threat to the government .
With the Khmer Rouge laying down their arms and Hun Sen and Ranariddh working together , the country is poised to begin perhaps its most stable period in decades .
Nearly two million people died of execution , overwork , starvation or disease under the Khmer Rouge until they were ousted from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 .
The last main fighting force of the Khmer Rouge , the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two million Cambodians , have surrendered to the government , a journalist close to the rebels said on Saturday .
In 1997 , Thayer became the first journalist allowed to interview the Khmer Rouge 's late leader Pol Pot , who had not been seen in public in nearly two decades , and who died in April this year .
The surrender of the Khmer Rouge would bring to an end more than 30 years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist guerrilla 's insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the late 1960s .
They apparently no longer command any troops , but their former followers did not want to give them up .
Khem Nuon claimed he was negotiating on behalf of 5,000 remaining ragtag troops and 15,000 civilians living under Khmer Rouge control .
While it is possible there are some tiny bands of guerrillas still wandering the jungles , Thayer said he knew of no sizable Khmer Rouge fighting force that could pose a viable threat to the government .
The last main fighting force of the Khmer Rouge , the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two million Cambodians , surrendered to the government in a ceremony broadcast on national television Saturday .
The Khmer Rouge laying down their arms brings to an end more than 30 years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist guerrillas ' insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the late 1960s .
Although the three no longer command any troops , their former followers apparently did not want to give them up .
Thayer , who in 1997 became the first journalist to interview the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot , is one of few outsiders trusted by the guerrillas .
Although Cambodia still faces many problems , with the Khmer Rouge laying down their arms and Hun Sen and Ranariddh working together , the country is poised to begin perhaps its most potentially stable period in decades .

Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign of terror in the 1970s defected to the government Saturday in a deal marking the death rattle of the bloodstained revolutionary group but unlikely to bring them to justice .
Khieu Samphan , long the nominal Khmer Rouge leader while others held real power , and political chief Nuon Chea said in letters read by Hun Sen on national radio that they wished to become `` ordinary citizens . ''
The defections leave at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure , the one - legged general Ta Mok , known as `` The Butcher , '' and fewer than 100 die-hard loyalists .
The Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and sent the populations to agricultural labor camps in the countryside .
Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of a purported heart attack in April under house arrest by his ex- comrades .
Over the past two years , the government has adopted a policy of negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade them to end nearly two decades of stalemated civil war .
The area is controlled by one of their old comrades , Pol Pot 's brother-in-law Ieng Sary , the first Khmer Rouge leader to make peace with the government .
Their letters said they had sealed their defection by telephone Friday with Hun Sen , who formed a new government last month expected to curb the political instability long exploited by the Khmer Rouge .
The defections come weeks after Khmer Rouge chief of staff Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered .
In Thailand , which closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities , Maj . Gen . Wiwat Sattarak , chief of the border task force , said that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea moved to defect a month ago .
Youk Chhang , director of a Cambodian research center devoted to gathering evidence against the Khmer Rouge , said Hun Sen risks losing support from Cambodians if he prevents a trial .
The defection of Khmer Rouge intellectual Khieu Samphan to the Cambodian government brings an end to decades of posturing in which he played the moderate , public front -man for a gang of history 's worst killers .
The death knell comes eight months after Pol Pot , the supreme Khmer Rouge leader until he was purged in a power struggle in 1997 , succumbed to a purported heart attack .
But researchers who have studied Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge say that Khieu Samphan bore much more responsibility for the deaths of his countrymen than is often attributed to him .
`` Khieu Samphan 's political star rose literally on heaps of corpses , '' said Steven Heder , an expert on the Khmer Rouge who lectures at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies .
So did Pol Pot and other top leaders of what became the Khmer Rouge .
After Sihanouk was overthrown by a U.S . -backed coup in 1970 , the prince formed an alliance with the Khmer Rouge .
Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day , 1978 , and toppled the Khmer Rouge two weeks later .
The Khmer Rouge joined royalist and republican factions in an alliance to drive out the Vietnamese , Cambodia 's traditional enemy .
The Khmer Rouge boycotted U.N . -organized elections in 1993 .
Sihanouk , Prime Minister Hun Sen and other leaders often drew a distinction between Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge chieftains .
Stung by reminders in the press of his past support for the notorious Khmer Rouge , King Norodom Sihanouk reiterated today that he is willing to stand trial alongside the architects of Cambodia 's genocide .
In a statement faxed from Beijing , where the ailing king is receiving medical treatment , Sihanouk said he would renounce his royal immunity from prosecution to allow a tribunal to judge whether he was involved in atrocities committed during the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge .
`` As I 've said and written several times , I am ready to appear in front of a tribunal in charge of judging the Khmer Rouge and their real or supposed accomplices , '' the king said .
He was responding to a local news report recalling that he was briefly head of state during the Khmer Rouge regime .
After Sihanouk was deposed from power by his army chief Lon Nol in a 1970 U.S . -backed coup , he lent his name and popularity to the Khmer Rouge forces that were battling Lon Nol 's troops .
The Khmer Rouge forced a war-weakened population into agricultural collectives that were run like slave labor camps .
Sihanouk resigned in 1976 , but the Khmer Rouge kept him under house arrest until they were driven from power by an invading Vietnamese army in 1979 .
The defection to the government last week of two senior members of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot 's inner circle -- Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea -- has strengthened calls for the aging guerrilla leadership to be tried for crimes against humanity .
Hun Sen , a low-level Khmer Rouge commander until 1977 , has refused to arrest the pair until a warrant is issued by a court .
At the request of Cambodia 's leaders , U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan sent a trio of legal experts to Cambodia in November to review evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities and assess the possibility of bringing the group 's senior leaders to justice .
The Cambodian government and a visiting U.N . legal team began tough negotiations Thursday over a proposed genocide trial for former Khmer Rouge leaders .
The extremist policies of the Khmer Rouge are held responsible for the death of an estimated 1.7 million people when the communist group held power from 1975-79 .
In the past year , after two decades in the jungle waging civil war , several top Khmer Rouge leaders have surrendered or been arrested , making them vulnerable to prosecution .
Sam Rainsy said Cambodia needed an international tribunal to prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders `` and put an end to impunity in this country , '' a reference to the ability of officials and influential people to escape justice .
Prime Minister Hun Sen favors bringing the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial but says pushing too hard could renew the civil war .
Critics say neither Hun Sen nor his junior partner in the coalition government , Prince Norodom Ranariddh , want a trial that would highlight their past links to the Khmer Rouge .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia _ As passions rise over whether to put former leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial , King Norodom Sihanouk volunteered Monday to join them in the dock to answer for his past associations with the brutal communist movement .
`` I am ready to appear in front of a tribunal in charge of judging the Khmer Rouge and their real or supposed accomplices , '' the king said in a statement from Beijing , where he spends much of his time .
Many people in public life today _ including Prime Minister Hun Sen _ have had links with the Khmer Rouge , either while they ruled the country or in the next decade when a coalition of royalists , democrats and Khmer Rouge forces battled a Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh .
The preparations appear to be focusing on a dozen top figures from the Khmer Rouge Central Committee and the torture house at Tuol Sleng prison , where at least 14,000 people were killed .
The two men were allowed to tour the capital , Phnom Penh , then visit the seaside resort of Sihanoukville and the temples of Angkor before returning last Monday to Pailin , an enclave of former Khmer Rouge in a remote area of western Cambodia .
The king , who is 76 , lent his name to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas after he was ousted in a U.S . -backed coup led by his army chief , Lon Nol , in 1970 .
But Sihanouk was placed under house arrest for the final three years of Khmer Rouge rule .
He was one of the millions of people who suffered severely at the hands of the Khmer Rouge , losing 14 family members .
Hun Sen was a middle-ranking Khmer Rouge field commander until he broke with the movement in 1977 , but most historians say he does not appear to have been involved in Khmer Rouge atrocities , and he appears to face little threat from a tribunal focusing on those years .
The head of his political party , Chea Sim , as well as his co-defense minister , Tea Banh , were members of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s .
PHNOM PENH , December 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The defection of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea , remaining top Khmer Rouge hard-line leaders , to the government of Cambodia Friday evening meant the end of Khmer Rouge 's decades of war .

The Khmer Rouge , who caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979 , remained a potent guerrilla force in 1993 and boycotted the polls , threatening to kill Cambodians who voted .
`` Let bygones be bygones , '' said Khieu Samphan , head of state between 1975 and 1979 , when the savage rule of the Khmers Rouges over Cambodia resulted in nearly 2 million deaths .
The United States suggested something along these lines last year , confining the tribunal 's scope to acts committed from 1975 to 1979 , the years the Khmers Rouges held power .
Youk Chhang , a researcher who has prepared evidence against Khmer Rouge leaders at the Documentation Center of Cambodia , called Duch a `` very essential '' witness against the people who are responsible for the deaths of more than a million people when they held power from 1975 to 1979 .
Cambodian leader Hun Sen says that upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993 monitored by the United Nations , thanks largely to the collapse of the Khmer Rouge .
In an interview seen Tuesday in his monthly Cambodia New Vision bulletin , Hun Sen said that security had greatly improved in the past five years despite tensions that led to a bloody power struggle with Prince Norodom Ranariddh last year .
`` In 1993 , Khmer Rouge occupied many places ... , ''
The attacks on the monks , who have been kicked , clubbed and shot at , have intensified opposition to Hun Sen . But attacking monks _ held in untouchable reverence by Cambodians a couple of generations ago before the genocidal Khmer Rouge exterminated the clergy _ reflects changes in Cambodian society as much as Hun Sen 's determination to hold power .
But after they came to power , the Khmer Rouge abolished religion , forcing monks to abandon their robes and perform hard labor .
But Cambodia is a country of few rules , where the elite live by corruption and Khmer Rouge killers join the government .
Lao Mong Hay , director of the Khmer Institute for Democracy , said recent incidents involving monks are `` just a reflection of the society. ''
Stung by reminders in the press of his past support for the notorious Khmer Rouge , King Norodom Sihanouk reiterated today that he is willing to stand trial alongside the architects of Cambodia 's genocide .
In a statement faxed from Beijing , where the ailing king is receiving medical treatment , Sihanouk said he would renounce his royal immunity from prosecution to allow a tribunal to judge whether he was involved in atrocities committed during the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge .

After Sihanouk was deposed from power by his army chief Lon Nol in a 1970 U.S . -backed coup , he lent his name and popularity to the Khmer Rouge forces that were battling Lon Nol 's troops .
Sihanouk was named head of state after the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 , but was locked in his palace by the communists as they embarked on their brutal attempt to create an agrarian utopia .
The Khmer Rouge forced a war-weakened population into agricultural collectives that were run like slave labor camps .
The defection to the government last week of two senior members of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot 's inner circle -- Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea -- has strengthened calls for the aging guerrilla leadership to be tried for crimes against humanity .

At the request of Cambodia 's leaders , U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan sent a trio of legal experts to Cambodia in November to review evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities and assess the possibility of bringing the group 's senior leaders to justice .
The two aging Khmer Rouge leaders had a message for their countrymen .
Nuon Chea , `` Brother Number 2 '' to the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot , offered similar advice : `` This is an old story .
They are more intent on clinging to power than seeing justice done .
People have accepted the need to forgive Khmer Rouge foot- soldiers in order to end a chronic civil war .
Moreover , 20 years after the Khmers Rouges were ousted from power , Cambodia still struggles on the brink of chaos , ruled by the gun , not by law .
Putting Khmer Rouge leaders on trial is the first essential step towards creating any credible legal system , and restraining the country 's current leaders .
A third option would be for some country with the appropriate domestic legislation in place _ Canada or Australia have been suggested _ to ask Cambodia to extradite Khmer Rouge leaders for trial in its courts for crimes against humanity .
The obstacles in the way of such trials have been removed .
Though most Khmer Rouge leaders are living in Pailin , a border town where the government 's grip is tenuous , they no longer have an army .
Concerted pressure from aid donors would win his cooperation , however reluctant , in bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to trial .
BANGKOK , Thailand _ Cambodians know him as the cruelest of the Khmer Rouge torturers , the author of such directives as `` Use the hot method , even if it kills him '' and , in the margin of a list of 17 children , `` Kill them all. ''
Kang Kek Ieu , better known by his revolutionary nickname , Duch , was the head of the Khmer Rouge secret police and the commandant of Tuol Sleng prison , where at least 14,000 people were tortured and killed .
In the 20 years since the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power , he converted to Christianity and devoted himself to spreading the Gospel and to helping refugees who fled the brutality of his regime .
`` I have no plan to summon him to Phnom Penh as a witness in Ta Mok 's case , '' said Ngin Sam An , the investigating judge in the case of the only Khmer Rouge official to have been arrested , the commander Ta Mok .
`` He is the key to the conviction of Khmer Rouge leaders .
Prime Minister Hun Sen has resisted international demands that other Khmer Rouge leaders be arrested , saying he fears this could cause a violent reaction among their followers , who now live in semiautonomous areas in the north and west of the country .
The two men surrendered last December and were given a guided tour of the country before returning to the security of the remote Khmer Rouge -controlled town of Pailin .
`` The first was Pol Pot , '' he said , naming the Khmer Rouge leader who died a year ago .
Duch , whose thin face , large teeth and prominent ears made him one of the more recognizable faces in photographs of the Khmer Rouge , said he was fully prepared to face trial .
`` I have done very bad things in my life , '' he said , the first Khmer Rouge leader to make that admission .

Let 's now give a welcome to the Wiggles , a goofy new import from Australia .
His group had kids howling with joy with routines involving Dorothy the Dinosaur , Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog .
While relatively new to the American scene , the Wiggles seem to be on to something , judging by kids ' reactions to the group 's belly-slapping shows .
Six of the Wiggles ' videos have reached multiplatinum status in Australia .
And `` The Wiggles Movie '' was the second highest-grossing film in Australia in 1998 .
`` It 's pretty mind-boggling , '' said Field , 36 , explaining how three of the Wiggles got degrees in early childhood education , began fooling around in 1991 , and cut a record they thought might appeal to kids .
In Australia , the Wiggles is like really huge .
Field said he was overwhelmed by what he saw as the Wiggles traveled the country .
The Wiggles will release two videos in the United States this fall : `` Yummy Yummy '' and `` Wiggle Time , '' hoping to capitalize on their U.S . tour and their 30-minute `` The Wiggles '' program , which is shown weekday mornings on the Fox Family Channel .

The other is quantum mechanics , which describes the unseen universe of subatomic particles _ electrons , quarks and , perhaps , elements yet unknown .
NEW YORK _ Four months after scientists at a particle collider in Switzerland announced they had recreated traces of a primordial form of matter , a more powerful device at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island is now smashing particles together in hope of making the substance in bulk and learning more about the earliest moments of the universe , the laboratory said Tuesday .
Frank Wilczek , one of three theoretical physicists who originally predicted that a soup of free quarks and gluons would be produced in hot compressed matter , said the CERN results `` hint around at the possibility of a quark-gluon description. ''
So `` strange stars ' would offer scientists their only chance to observe a large and stable piece of quark matter , the report added .
The Standard Model postulates that virtually every conceivable state of matter or energy can be embodied in a few particles and the `` matter particles '' include six kinds of quarks , and six kinds of leptons -LRB- The term lepton derives from the Greek word for `` small `` -RRB- .
Kendall , Taylor and Friedman , who first met as graduate students at Stanford , conducted their research at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center using a two -mile-long particle accelerator able to boost beams of electrons to an energy of 22 billion electron-volts .
Before the device 's start-up last year , the laboratory started a public relations campaign to allay a welter of conspiracy theories about the particle collider , called the relativistic heavy ion collider , or RHIC -LRB- pronounced RICK -RRB- .
Though the $ 600 million collider opened about a year ago at the lab in Upton , N.Y . , the achievement of the first particle collisions was delayed by technical problems .
But quarks rarely exist as separate entities , and it 's possible to get only a brief glimpse of their existence in high-energy particle accelerators .
WASHINGTON , July 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Scientists Friday hailed the finding of first direct evidence of the existence of tau neutrino as a milestone in particle physics .
Physicist Wolfgang Pauli first proposed in 1930 the existence of a neutral particle , later named `` neutrino , '' for `` little neutral one , '' by Enrico Fermi .

In 1974 , using beams of electrons and antielectrons , or positrons , Richter discovered a particle that came to be called Psi/ J .
1990 : Jerome I . Friedman , Henry W . Kendall , United States ; Richard E . Taylor , Canada , for investigating the scattering of electrons and refining models of quarks .
Do supposedly fundamental particles like quarks and leptons actually have internal structure ?
It contained two quarks possessing a previously unknown flavor called charm .
The stupendous power of the Tevatron made possible the 1995 discovery of the top quark _ the last of six flavors of quarks predicted by the standard model theory of particle physics .
Gell- Mann predicted the existence of the most basic subatomic elements yet found and named them quarks .
Characterizing the quarks cleared the way for quantum chromodynamics -LRB- QCD -RRB- , the field theory describing the strong force binding particles together in the atom 's nucleus .
At The New York Times , for example , the science editor , Walter Sullivan , had been steeping himself in astrophysics for decades when in 1965 two scientists at Bell Labs , Dr . Arno A . Penzias and Dr . Robert W . Wilson , accidentally discovered a faint microwave radio signal coming from all directions in the sky .
It 's probably OK to call a proton a `` beanbag '' containing three quarks , but to call a proton accelerator an `` atom smasher '' makes physicists squirm .

In 1974 , using beams of electrons and antielectrons , or positrons , Richter discovered a particle that came to be called Psi/ J .
They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a fluid .
The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr . Guenter Blobel , 63 , a German native and U.S . citizen , who discovered how proteins find their rightful places in cells .
But when scientists discovered the subatomic particles , they realized Newton 's laws of physics did not work at the subatomic level .
They put him in the same category with the late American physicist Albert Michelson , who , in an 1894 speech at the University of Chicago , lamented `` the more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered , and these are now so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly remote.

All these make `` Galo Negro '' stand out in a sea of world music releases .
The careful , relatively decorous , professional music of the first two days was replaced by rowdy , noisy , hormonally charged -LRB- though equally professional -RRB- rock .
The music was louder , male band members took off their shirts , and a mosh pit roiled for seven hours , not even stopping when Joan Osborne sang a ballad like `` One of Us . ''
While Third Eye Blind is a San Francisco band , its musical models are British .
Once the band had played that hit , a good part of the audience started to head for the parking lots .

Yuengling served as a staff sergeant with the U.S . Army Air Corps during World War II .
In World War II , Bryer was a captain and battalion surgeon in the Seventh Armored Division in Europe , and he received a Bronze Star and a Silver Star .
The memories were n't all pleasant for George Bush as he toured a new museum gallery dedicated to World War II battles in the Pacific .
It wo n't be a real battle , but Marvin Schroeder , the living history coordinator for the Adm . Nimitz Museum and Historical Center , promises that visitors will get to see an authentic World War II assault , and they 'll smell it as well .
Schroeder and 35 members of his World War II re-enactment group spread out across the state when the Spielberg movie opened last month .
They sent men dressed in World War II uniforms to theaters in San Antonio , Austin and Houston .
It shows that World War II brought us into the nuclear age , Schroeder says .
More than 65 World War II vehicles were used in the parade .
`` Schools might have two days to teach World War II history .
There was his grandfather , Admiral John `` Slew '' McCain , Class of 1906 , a grizzled old sea dog who commanded aircraft carriers in the Pacific during World War II .
Also , the strain of operations in World War II was immense. ''
During World War II , the elder McCain won the Silver Star while commanding two submarines : the USS Gunnel , which sunk freighters and battled Japanese destroyers in the Pacific ; and the USS Dentuda , which was on hand at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay .
After the war , Bryer returned to his alma mater , Johns Hopkins University , where he and a team of researchers developed Aureomycin , tetracycline , polymyxin agents and other antibiotics .
He joined the Chicago Daily News as a reporter after the war , later becoming city editor and assistant managing editor .
`` I saw the island over which my roommate was shot down , the first casualty of our squadron , '' said the former president , who served as a young pilot during the war .
Bush cut the ribbon Friday on the George Bush Gallery of the National Museum of the Pacific War , part of the larger Admiral Nimitz Museum and Historical Center .
A group in the Dallas-Fort Worth area did the same .
`` Most groups do Indian wars , the Civil War ; not many people do anything from the 20th century . ''
It took until 1994 to come up with a base plan on how to teach World War II. ''
Last year , he engineered a Marine landing on Galveston Island ; in 1995 he put together a `` Welcome Home Parade '' for veterans of the war in the Pacific .
`` That 's something they never got after the war , '' he said .
Schroeder insists that he and his re-enactors are not trying to romanticize war .
With children , he explained , they do n't even talk about war .
The latest addition to the park , the $ 3 million National Museum of the Pacific War and George Bush Gallery , is scheduled to open to the public June 12 .
`` What did you say ? ''
According to his grandson , McCain was the quintessential combat officer _ a throwback , a gregarious , beloved commander who did n't worry whether his uniform was pressed .
But the war , and his lifestyle , taxed his health .
`` He smoked and he drank and he did n't take care of himself .
Bill McCain , who graduated from West Point , chased Pancho Villa with Gen . Blackjack Pershing , served as an artillery officer during World War I and attained the rank of brigadier general .
After the family moved to Mississippi , a number of McCain 's ancestors fought in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy .
At Episcopal High , a private boarding school in Alexandria , Va . , McCain was a rebel , earning the nickname `` McNasty '' from classmates who did n't dare cross him .
He did just enough to pass the classes he did n't find stimulating .
`` Did you have fun with her ?
Speaking to the Annapolis Class of 1970 , Jack McCain made light of the antiwar slogan `` make love , not war , '' by noting that naval officers `` were men enough to do both , '' according to Faith of My Fathers .
Dewey did not oppose New Deal programs , which caused Republicans to grouse about `` me-tooism , '' but which also made him a formidable candidate .
As the war and homefront rationing dragged on , he abandoned his nonpolitical strategy and spoke on Sept . 23 to a friendly audience , the Teamsters Union , and to voters via radio .
Hooting and hollering , banging the tables , the Teamsters wanted more , as did millions at home .

Once these nature-bound visitors reach the summit , many find themselves lying on their backs on top of the smooth granite dome , watching the the vultures and hawks circling and weaving through the white clouds and clear blue skies .
The two did n't get a chance to meet .
Bush explains that he served under Adm . Chester Nimitz , the Fredericksburg native for whom the complex is named .
The primary purpose , she said , is to reach a younger audience and give them a better understanding of the contributions that were made by the generation of World War II .

Last fall , Congress decreed he will be the last in a long line of naval officers who have kept an eye on the oil field since a scandal rocked President Warren Harding 's administration in 1922 .
By the time Harding died on Aug . 2 , 1923 , apparently of a heart attack , the whistle was blowing on Teapot .
But , unlike the frenzied 1920s when there was so much oil that one drilling dispute had to be settled by a detachment of Marines , the reserves have dwindled to the point that government officials fear that if they open Teapot Dome to competitive bidding , they may not get a bidder .
Tunison , a petroleum engineer , keeps watch over Naval Petroleum Reserve No . 3 , better known as Teapot Dome .
At about the same time , Department of Energy officials hope to submit legislation to sell Teapot Dome to a private company or a group that would open it to drilling research .
In 1981 , production at Teapot Dome peaked at 5,000 barrels a day .
Time has even taken its toll on a nearby rock formation that looked like a teapot to early prospectors .
A 1962 windstorm broke off the teapot 's spout .
But the dome , underground layers of rock shaped liked an upside-down bowl , is better known for its place in history than its oil .
The Navy never used Teapot Dome 's oil directly .
Sinclair Oil Co . , with the green dinosaur logo on gas station signs , remains the biggest buyer of Teapot Dome oil .
After the scandal , the Navy retook control of the field and most of its oil was undisturbed until the late 1970s .
With oil prices hovering between dlrs 14 and dlrs 15 a barrel , the prospect of finding a buyer for Teapot Dome may not be good .
UNDATED : As analysts roam far and wide in their efforts to explain the stock market 's recent swoon , Yale Hirsch 's Smart Money newsletter has distinguished itself by providing a historical analysis of market reactions to presidential scandal .
It does n't come all wrapped up in a neat little package in some cases , but the advent of scandal and stock market sinking spells are in close enough proximity to challenge your belief in coincidences .
After the Reagan administration 's Iran-Contra scandal broke in late 1986 , it was less than a year before the resounding crash that climaxed a brief but brutal bear market that cost the Dow Jones industrial average more than one-third of its value from August to October of 1987 .
From the time of the Nixon -era Watergate scandal marked by the `` Saturday Night Massacre '' in October 1973 , the Dow lost 40 percent during an ensuing 12-month bear debacle .
The Teapot Dome scandal broke during the Calvin Coolidge presidency but was a creature of the Warren G . Harding administration .
Before that bit of unpleasantness you have to go back 50 more years to the Grant regime , which saw four Cabinet officers involved in scandal .
But the scandal that really smeared the memory of President Warren Harding bubbled 75 years ago from Teapot Dome , a vast pool of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here .
The Starr Report could dethrone the Teapot Dome .
`` The scandal today is n't nothing compared to Teapot Dome , '' Pauline Schultz insisted , at her local history museum .
Showing visitors around today , she lectured insistently : `` The Teapot Dome scandal was the largest in the United States .
At the town offices next door , Melvin Dimick , a plumber who doubles as mayor , defended Teapot 's primacy , saying : `` It 's right up there at the top .
That was one big financial scandal .
But , even before Monica Lewinsky came along , time had not been kind to the Teapot Dome .
Wyoming 's famous winds battered the signature landmark , a beige sandstone formation named Teapot Rock by passing cowboys .
The decline of the Teapot Dome field is part of a wider oil implosion in Wyoming , a state heavily dependent on energy royalties to pave highways and pay for schools .
Today , surveying this arid landscape where there are more capped wells than active ones , it is hard to imagine the days when the nation 's attention burned on this 15-square-mile patch of rocks , a barren place with such names as Dead Horse Road and Dead Dog Draw .
But , about 10 miles south of Salt Creek lay Teapot Dome , an untapped reserve on federal land that was off limits to private companies .
In April 1921 , only days after Harding 's inauguration , Harry Sinclair , owner of Sinclair Oil Co . , privately negotiated a lease on the Teapot Dome with the new Interior Secretary , Albert Fall .
In 1927 , Harding 's place in history was definitively tarnished when the Supreme Court annulled the Sinclair contract , and Miss Britton published a memoir , stating that Harding fathered her daughter in 1919 and that they kept up a sexual relationship while he was president .
`` For the general public , the revelation of a mistress and an illegitimate child was easier to grasp than the Teapot Dome . ''
But , here the consequence of Teapot Dome was as easy to grasp .
`` The scandal was so great , they had to wipe Teapot Dome off the map , '' Mrs . Schultz said of the Navy 's decision to shut the oil field .
Without the oil field , the town of Teapot Dome vanished , leaving only a few foundations visible today .
Following a rootless pattern of human habitation that has marked much of Wyoming in the 20th century , residents of Teapot simply moved their houses down the road , heading to the next boom town .
The federal government , in fact , wants to sell Teapot Dome .
The Mitchell-Stans trial was the first trial of defendants who had been high-ranking Nixon administration officials who had at least a tenuous link with the Watergate scandal .
Richard Nixon likewise is seen only as the president who was forced from office by the Watergate scandal , not as the outstanding foreign policy architect among the presidents of the second half of the 20th century .
Because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal , Bill Clinton faces a similar assessment despite the good he has done in guiding the nation 's prosperity , aiding education and trying to settle longstanding foreign disputes .
Looking over the current crop of presidential hopefuls , we should try to determine which candidate can best provide valorous , enlightened leadership in time of crisis , as did the giants of the past .

Incidents such as the Teapot Dome scandal so marred Warren G . Harding 's presidency that historians consider him among the worst presidents in the nation 's history .
The sympathetic new portrayals make one or more of three arguments : The first -LRB- not exactly new -RRB- is that , as far as graft is concerned , Harding was mainly a victim of guilt by association with corrupt appointees _ a common occupational hazard of the White House that has n't tarnished other presidents .
It took in the disapproving -LRB- -LRB- Herbert J . -RRB- -RRB- Hoover -LRB- -LRB- Harding 's commerce secretary and later president -RRB- -RRB- , who always thought he would have made a better president than Harding .
`` The novel 's success in turn prompted Nan Britton , an Ohio girl , daughter of a Marion doctor , to publish in 1927 `The President 's Daughter , ' asserting that she had had a baby girl by Harding in 1919 .
In `` The Strange Deaths of President Harding '' -LRB- University of Missouri , 1996 -RRB- , Ferrell says he found no credible evidence to support Miss Britton 's claim , often repeated as fact , of trysts with Harding in a White House closet .
I remember , and I know , and I also know that no strange woman ever came here to see President Warren G . Harding . '
Johnson concludes that Harding deserves the sort of reputation that he enjoyed in his lifetime _ as `` the kind of president American people of all classes love _ kind , genial , decent , ordinary , human , one of them. ''
`` It was President Harding , Cabinet Secretaries , there were many , many dignitaries involved. ''
In 1927 , Harding 's place in history was definitively tarnished when the Supreme Court annulled the Sinclair contract , and Miss Britton published a memoir , stating that Harding fathered her daughter in 1919 and that they kept up a sexual relationship while he was president .
`` The paradox of Harding is that he died as one of the most beloved and popular presidents , yet within a few short years , his legacy as president and his personal reputation became permanently damaged , '' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony , author of `` Florence Harding : The First Lady , the Jazz Age and the Death of America 's Most Scandalous President '' -LRB- William Morrow , 1998 -RRB- .
Harding was succeeded by Coolidge , who spent much of his five-year presidency napping in the White House while business and industrial leaders pretty much ran the country .
It seems that when Will Rogers called on an anxious President Warren Harding during the Teapot Dome scandal , he told Harding : `` I 'd like to tell you some of my latest jokes , Mr . President . ''
The government took control in 1915 when President Woodrow Wilson set it aside in case the Navy needed oil for battleships , destroyers and other warships as World War I approached .
The Monica Lewinsky sex scandal will leave a lasting impression on President Clinton 's long-term reputation and may overshadow the accomplishments of his administration , two Houston scholars said Monday .
`` I could not have foreseen that a president could be involved in a sexual scandal and it not have pulled down his approval rating , '' said John W . Sloan , political science professor at the University of Houston .
The president best known for his sexual escapades , however , was John F . Kennedy , who was rumored to have had countless affairs , including one with star Marilyn Monroe .
In the past , Brace said presidents were able to control what journalists wrote about them because Washington press corps careers were based on access to the president .
It 's maybe not going too far out on a limb to say that President Clinton is worried about his legacy nowadays .
`` In 1926 , a novel , ` Revelry , ' describes a guilty president who poisons himself to escape scandals and exposure .
`` Reily offered the testimony of the doorkeeper at the executive offices for nearly 35 years , his friend Patrick Kenney , who told him he `never had heard of Nan Britton , and that he had never admitted any woman by such a name in to see or meet any president ! '
In the event that Ms . Britton might have gone to the White House proper , rather than the executive offices , there was the testimony of Ike Hoover -LRB- -LRB- chief White House usher -RRB- -RRB- , who had come into the mansion during the administration of President Benjamin Harrison and left at the outset of the Franklin Roosevelt administration .
`I am very glad to express my approval and hearty sympathy for the effort of the Palestine Foundation Fund , in behalf of the restoration of Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people , ' the president wrote to that organization in an unpublished letter that I found in his papers .
The first president to discuss civil rights in the South so frankly , he was loudly cheered by blacks and met with silent stares from whites .
The 55-year-old president had intimate encounters with a 24-year-old campaign volunteer in a cloak closet off the Oval Office in the White House .
Showing visitors around today , she lectured insistently : `` The Teapot Dome scandal was the largest in the United States .
In 1915 , with World War I raging in Europe , President Woodrow Wilson reserved this field and others in the West to create a secure supply for oil -burning Navy ships .

SATELLITE-EXPORTS _ In a major rebuke of President Clinton 's export policy , House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to shift the control over exporting U.S . satellites back to the State Department from the Commerce Department .
GLOBAL-ECONOMY -LRB- Washington -RRB- _ On Monday President Clinton declared that with the world in its greatest economic turmoil in a half-century , `` the industrial world 's chief priority today , plainly , is to spur growth. ''
Rosenthal comments on President Clinton 's problems .
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton 's admitted immoral behavior has thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of the American presidency : Should the president be a moral leader ?
`` In an ideal world , the president would be the paragon of virtue , '' said former New York Gov . Mario Cuomo , a Democrat .
`` There was a time when people expected presidents to be Superman , '' said Mansfield , who is 95 .
No president is on the pedestal any more. ''
Henry Graff , a professor emeritus of history at Columbia University , said `` the wheel of history has to turn fortuitously '' for a president to have the opportunity to exhibit moral leadership .
Herbert Hoover , for example , was so scrupulously honest that he did not collect his salary as president .
One of the few presidents who is widely regarded as a true moral leader during a time of peace was Theodore Roosevelt , who from his `` bully pulpit '' preached again and again about honesty in government .
For all the talk of integrity , some people may not be more comfortable with a president who commands the same personal respect as , say , a member of the clergy .
A common perception is that politicians who are too clean may find it too distasteful to do some of the unsavory things that a president must do , like outmaneuver political opponents .
`` We do n't necessarily want them to be Mother Teresa _ We do n't necessarily want them to be pure as can be , '' said Thomas Cronin , an authority on American presidents who is also the president of Whitman College in Walla Walla , Wash . `` The world of international affairs requires a toughness of demeanor. ''
No one ever questioned the uprightness of President Gerald R . Ford or his successor , Jimmy Carter , who in the 1976 campaign presented himself as an antidote to the dishonesty of government in the Watergate era .
Just about any president would be considered downright charming , and virtuous , if compared with Andrew Jackson , a dictatorial , nasty , temperamental man who always seemed to find himself facing down an opponent in a duel with a pistol .
But that did not prevent Jackson from earning a place in history as a respectable president symbolizing abiding national values .
And Franklin D . Roosevelt , the president viewed by many as America 's most effective moral leader this century _ revered even as he forced Americans to make huge personal sacrifices in the Depression and in World War II _ was hardly a role model in private life .
Nixon , of course , became the first president to be forced from office because of ethical misdeeds , although many people still insist that he was an effective leader , particularly in foreign policy .
And Truman was not particularly popular when he was president ; only recently have historians portrayed him as a heroic figure .
The most blatant distinction between a president 's personal morals and public values was drawn by Democratic National Committee national chairman Steve Grossman speaking , as Clinton looked on , at a recent fund-raising event in New York .
President , '' he said , `` it seems to me that you have demonstrated , at least in my adult lifetime , a higher commitment to the kind of moral leadership that I value in public service and public policy than any person I have ever met. ''
Former Vice President Dan Quayle , who is considering a run for the White House in 2000 , volunteered on national TV recently that he had not had an extramarital affair .
When Carter ran for president , he did not repudiate Nixon and Ford as much as he tried to promote the general healing of the nation .
Some Republican strategists said they feared that Sen . John Ashcroft , R-Mo . , who may run for president in 2000 , was skating at the line of appropriateness when he said , `` We have a president who views a vulnerable woman from the perspective of a predator . ''
Washingtonian magazine credits recently resigned Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for stabilizing global financial markets , saving the Mexican economy and preventing Asian economic problems from becoming catastrophes for the United States , and calls him the fifth best Cabinet secretary in the century .
Numbers one through four , in descending order : George C . Marshall , Harry Truman 's secretary of state , author of the Marshall Plan ; Carter Glass , Treasury secretary under Woodrow Wilson , who implemented the Federal Reserve System ; Henry Kissinger , secretary of state under Richard Nixon , for opening relations with China ; Henry Morgenthau Jr . , Treasury secretary to FDR , who was `` among the first to warn the president of Nazi genocide. ''
Each of this year 's presidential hopefuls appears to have found a past president to emulate , just as Roosevelt patterned his New Deal to some degree on the legacy of Woodrow Wilson and Reagan sought to resuscitate the starchy image of Calvin Coolidge .
The United States fared better in the 20th century .
Then came Herbert Hoover , a talented engineer , who probably would have been an outstanding president had the Great Depression not come crashing down on him and the nation .
Richard Nixon likewise is seen only as the president who was forced from office by the Watergate scandal , not as the outstanding foreign policy architect among the presidents of the second half of the 20th century .
If Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W . Bush want to grab the attention of their audiences , they would do well to tear a page out of new book by Liz Carpenter titled : `` Start with a laugh. ''
Carpenter , a former Texas newspaperwoman who was Lady Bird Johnson 's press secretary and a speechwriter for President Lyndon B . Johnson , has a sure-fire formula for speechwriting : `` Start with a laugh , put the meat in the middle and wave the flag at the end. ''
When Rogers visited the White House in the FDR era , he asked first lady Eleanor Roosevelt where the president was .
The president , who had been accused of nepotism when he appointed his brother Bobby as the attorney general , told the gathering that `` Bobby wants to practice law and I thought he ought to get a little experience. ''
`` No , Mr . President , '' Hayes replied .
Carpenter recounts President Ronald Reagan 's one-liners when he was shot in an assassination attempt in 1981 .
When the Whitewater investigation first surfaced , President Clinton attended a White House Correspondents Association dinner and said : `` I 'm happy to be here .
Clinton then recalled that the press dinners began in 1944 when President Roosevelt delivered his fireside chats over radio .
`` It 's not much different today except that you insist that the president sit directly on the logs. ''
Can Vice President Al Gore be his own man only when President Clinton is not around ?
In the manner of the `` Survivor '' television series , the president has been kicked off the island and told to get lost so that he does n't detract from Gore 's election campaign .

Von Uexkull , a stamp dealer , sold his collection for about dlrs 1 million and started the awards in 1980 to recognize work that he believed the Nobel Prizes were ignoring .
Since 1980 , the awards have recognized a wide range of activists and alternative scientists , ranging from American anti- chemicals activist Cindy Duehring _ who 's confined to her North Dakota home because of severe chemical sensitivity _ to the Committee of Soldiers ' Mothers of Russia , the Indian group Science Writers ' Forum of Kerala and Greek homeopathic physician George Vithoulkas .
The awards usually go to four recipients a year , dividing up a prize pool that this year is worth 1.8 million kronor -LRB- dlrs 234,000 -RRB- .

Sen , who was visiting Manhattan on Wednesday , said he was thrilled that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which awards the prize , at long last acknowledged his field .
The Canadian -born economist `` has established the foundation for the theory that dominates practical policy considerations of monetary and fiscal policy in open economies , '' the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said .
But as usual , the secretive members of the awards committee did n't give a hint following Wednesday 's final meeting .
'' We had our last regular meeting , and have reached a decision that will be announced on Oct . 13 , '' said Geir Lundestad , a non-voting secretary who attends the five -member awards committee 's meetings .

Nobel prizes , named after Swedish chemist Alfred Bernhard Nobel who died in 1896 , were set up in 1901 in the fields of chemistry , physics , medicine , peace and literature .
Arguments over the Academy 's choices are inevitable , considering the instructions they were given .
The politicians were picked for the peace prize , which includes a 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 938,000 -RRB- cash award , because the Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks that lead to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement .
`` We all know that there are still major problems to be faced , '' said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted , according to a copy of his planned speech .
Hume , 61 , and Trimble , 54 , accept their awards , which include a gold medal , before about 1,000 people , including Norway 's King Harald V and Queen Sonja , at the Oslo City Hall .

I was very pleased to learn that the Nobel Prize was not given to me .
First , because it spared me the great problem of disposing of the money , which , like all money , can lead only to evil , in my view ; and second , because it has given me the honor and great pleasure of receiving such expressions of sympathy from so many highly esteemed although unknown persons .
After a century of Einstein , Bohr , Churchill , Pasternak , Enders , Watson , Mother Teresa , the Dalai Lama and other laureates , what will the world 's most prestigious awards institution do for an encore ?
`` We are presently going through the archives for 1901-1949 and will in a year 's time provide information about who nominated who during that time period , '' Dr . Nils Ringertz of Stockholm , director of the Electronic Nobel Museum , recently said in an e-mail message .

This year 's Nobel Prize in literature will be announced Thursday , weeks earlier than most years , and only the Swedish Academy knows which world author will be crowned .
Custom dictates that the prize date be announced just days in advance .
Then there 's Salman Rushdie , the Booker Prize winner who lived under a death threat after his book `` The Satanic Verses '' was accused of blaspheming Islam .
Jose Saramago of Portugal won last year 's Nobel Prize in literature .
Robert A . Mundell of Columbia University in New York won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences today for his analysis of exchange rates and how they affect monetary policies .
The Canadian -born economist `` has established the foundation for the theory that dominates practical policy considerations of monetary and fiscal policy in open economies , '' the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said .
`` His work on monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas has inspired generations of researchers .
He served in the research department of the International Monetary Fund from 1961 to 1963 , which `` apparently stimulated Mundell 's choice of research problems ; it also gave his research additional leverage among economic policy makers , '' it said .
Economists said Mundell 's research has made important contributions far outside esoteric academic circles by clarifying how exchange rates fluctuate when a government shifts from a flexible to a fixed monetary policy .
Mundell published a pioneering article in 1963 on the short-term effects of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy , the citation said .
In addition , he has served as an international monetary adviser for more than 40 years .
Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for their work on valuing risky `` derivatives '' investments such as stock options .
The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel , who invented dynamite .
The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr . Guenter Blobel , 63 , a German native and U.S . citizen , who discovered how proteins find their rightful places in cells .
Veltman , both of the Netherlands , won the physics prize Tuesday for developing more precise calculations used to predict and confirm the existence of subatomic particles .
Ahmed Zewail , an Egyptian - American , won the chemistry prize Tuesday for pioneering the use of rapid-fire laser flashes that illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule .
The final Nobel -- the peace prize -- is to be announced Friday in Oslo , Norway .
The winner of the prize for physiology or medicine will be named on Oct . 9 , physics and chemistry on Oct . 10 , and economics on Oct . 11 , according to the foundation 's Web site .
The peace prize laureate -- the only one awarded in Oslo , Norway -- will be announced on Oct . 12 .
In keeping with tradition , the Swedish Academy will give the date for the announcement of the literature prize later .

The 400 or so Lemhi live on a reservation 200 miles south of here , on desert land set aside for two much bigger tribes .
Spurred on by an extraordinary surge of interest in the journey of Lewis and Clark , hoopla over a new dollar coin honoring Sacajawea and recent scholarly finds that bolster Lemhi legal claims , the Indians from the west side of the Continental Divide are stirred by their last best hope for a homeland .
The Lemhi have asked President Clinton to carve out a small piece of federal land in the Salmon River country on the Idaho - Montana border as a place where the tribe can tell its story to the hordes of Lewis and Clark history buffs , honor their dead and try to stitch some of the past to the present .
While other tribes have spent decades going through long and usually futile efforts to regain full tribal recognition , the Lemhi are making a direct appeal to the conscience of the current occupant of the White House _ a familiar Lemhi tack .
In 1875 , the tribe was given a small reservation in this valley by executive order of President Ulysses S . Grant , who was impressed by the Lemhi 's unique role in Western history and their record of cooperation with the Americans .
Their affairs are handled by the much larger Shoshone - Bannock tribes on the reservation at Fort Hall , Idaho .
Lewis was counting on Sacajawea to be a translator with Shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the Continental Divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
With Sacajawea 's help , they crossed the Continental Divide at Lemhi Pass , then came upon a band of Shoshone .
Also , as other historians have noted , Svingen said , the Lemhi were told they would lose their food rations if they did not agree to leave the valley .
`` Given the fact that the Lemhi did not want to leave their home , and that the document which is supposed to have their signatures agreeing to the move could not be found _ that makes me very suspicious they willingly gave up their home , '' Svingen said .
The odds of the Lemhi being restored as a tribe in the valley where they used to live are certainly long .
The Shoshone-Bannock say the Lemhi belong with them at Fort Hall .
Ariwite said the Lemhi 's best hope is to get a small bit of land from the federal government , which would be used as a Sacajawea interpretive center , and a home for some tribal members who have never felt welcome at Fort Hall .
Congress has been asked by Idaho elected officials to consider plans for a Sacajawea center here at Salmon , but not one that would be run by the Lemhi .
Today , the Salmon Savages remain , while Ariwite , 45 , and the rest of the Lemhi Shoshone tribe are gone .
And it is here , today , that Ariwite is working as a Shoshone Moses , trying to bring his people home in what many view as a quixotic attempt at restoring a tribe .
The U.S . government is slow to recognize tribes in a process that can take decades , and many people in Salmon River country fear a return of the Lemhi Shoshones could threaten everything from water rights to employment in a valley where both water and jobs are scarce .
Svingen is writing a book about the Lemhi and helping them seek federal restoration as a tribe .
The Lemhi have been `` hostages '' of the Sho-Bans , he said , the foster children on a reservation where they never felt they belonged .
The Shoshone-Bannock tribe is composed of bands the Lemhi often fought .
is soliciting votes and suggestions for the image of Sacajawea that will adorn a gold-colored dollar coin to be issued in 2000 .
Rep . Michael Castle , R - Del . , who chairs the House monetary subcommittee , says he 's still hoping that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will ditches Sacajawea and opts instead for the Statue of Liberty , which he thinks is more familiar .
A : First , her name : According to the U.S . Mint , historians disagree over how it 's spelled -LRB- Sacagawea or Sacajawea , among others -RRB- , and how it 's translated -LRB- either as `` boat launcher '' or `` bird woman '' -RRB- .
In fact , it seems to most closely resemble a tribe in Japan .
PAKISTAN-MOOD -LRB- Rawalpindi , Pakistan -RRB- _ In the bazaars of Rawalpindi , life goes on as it did before Pakistan was plunged into a state of emergency by its new military ruler .
But the tribe 's luck may be about to change .
`` They have Sacajawea heritage days , they have Sacajawea arts and crafts , they have everything but the real Indians who are Sacajawea 's people in the valley , '' said Ariwite , an Air Force veteran and high school principal who grew up in Salmon but now lives in New Mexico and in Fort Hall , Idaho .
`` The feeling we get is , `We do n't want you here , but we want your Sacajawea heritage. '' '
`` We all believe Sacajawea is not only the most famous Indian , but the most famous woman in America , '' said Stan Davis , mayor of this town of 3,000 , set in an isolated Rocky Mountain valley of heart-stopping beauty .
She became one of two young wives of Toussaint Charbonneau , a French - Canadian trader who won Sacajawea in a bet with the Indians .
When Charbonneau signed on with Lewis and Clark , Sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
For her services on the expedition , Sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , Charbonneau , received $ 500 .
`` Their treaty was never ratified , so basically they belong down here , '' said Duane Thompson , chairman of the Shoshone-Bannock Council , which governs the reservation .
And as soon as he did , he was attacked by Texas Gov . George W . Bush , the Republican front-runner considered most liable to damage should Buchanan generate a serious tri-corner competition .
But that dream caused him , by his own reckoning , to commit the biggest mistake of his life : defecting in 1993 from the executive suite at General Motors Corp . , which declined to build the advanced , cost-efficient plant he envisioned , and joining Volkswagen AG , which he said promised to build it but never did .
Ariwite said he will appeal this year to President Clinton for restoration of the Lemhis as a tribe with treaty rights , while plying other federal agencies for land grants and money to purchase private land .
The Lemhis are not a federally recognized tribe ; instead , they are considered part of the Shoshone-Bannock tribe on the Fort Hall Reservation , located 243 miles east of Boise .
Within three years , the tribe sent the Mormons scurrying back to Utah , but it was a short-lived reprieve .
There , they moved in with tribes of Shoshone-Bannock .
Leroy Boyer , Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Council chief , did not return phone calls .

The Lemhi Shoshone , living links to the teen-age girl who was instrumental in leading the Corps of Discovery over the Continental Divide in 1805 , have been all but erased from this place they have called home for hundreds of years .
In 1804 , Toussaint was hired by Lewis and Clark , not for his own skills but for those of Sacagawea .
She knew several Indian languages , and being Shoshone could help the explorers make contact with her people and acquire horses that were crucial to the expedition .
Little is documented about what happened to Sacagawea after the expedition , but she is believed to have died Dec . 20 , 1812 .
A : Yes , but many years after the fact .
A month later , a Japanese envoy made what was believed to be the first official apology on American soil for the attack 50 years earlier .
Q : Nearly 20 years ago , a nuclear reactor failed at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania , creating a crisis .
The transaction , the first sale of a nuclear plant by a U.S . utility , is expected to take one to two years to win approval from regulators , including the NRC .
SALMON , Idaho _ Here in the valley where the Shoshone teen-ager Sacajawea led Lewis and Clark to one of the most serendipitous encounters in the annals of discovery , the stores are full of Indian art , the pastures are grazed by Indian -bred horses , and the land itself is imprinted with Indian names .

The Lemhi have asked President Clinton to carve out a small piece of federal land in the Salmon River country on the Idaho - Montana border as a place where the tribe can tell its story to the hordes of Lewis and Clark history buffs , honor their dead and try to stitch some of the past to the present .
But that tumbledown village was destroyed by the local authorities more than 10 years ago .
The Lewis and Clark bicentennial is going to be our last fight .
When Charbonneau signed on with Lewis and Clark , Sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
Lewis was counting on Sacajawea to be a translator with Shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the Continental Divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
As Stephen Ambrose notes in his best-selling book on the Corps , `` Undaunted Courage '' -LRB- Simon and Schuster , 1996 -RRB- , the 60 Shoshone warriors who encountered the Americans could have wiped them out easily , ending the expedition .
For her services on the expedition , Sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , Charbonneau , received $ 500 .
Her son , Jean-Baptist , was later raised in part by William Clark .
Also , as other historians have noted , Svingen said , the Lemhi were told they would lose their food rations if they did not agree to leave the valley .

A Congress -appointed committee met Monday and Tuesday in Philadelphia , and after much polite debate , decided which famous female will adorn the new dollar coin .

SALMON , Idaho _ Here in the valley where the Shoshone teen-ager Sacajawea led Lewis and Clark to one of the most serendipitous encounters in the annals of discovery , the stores are full of Indian art , the pastures are grazed by Indian -bred horses , and the land itself is imprinted with Indian names .

`` We all believe Sacajawea is not only the most famous Indian , but the most famous woman in America , '' said Stan Davis , mayor of this town of 3,000 , set in an isolated Rocky Mountain valley of heart-stopping beauty .
Sacajawea was a Shoshone girl who had been kidnapped by Hidatsa Indians .
She became one of two young wives of Toussaint Charbonneau , a French - Canadian trader who won Sacajawea in a bet with the Indians .
When Charbonneau signed on with Lewis and Clark , Sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
Lewis was counting on Sacajawea to be a translator with Shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the Continental Divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
With Sacajawea 's help , they crossed the Continental Divide at Lemhi Pass , then came upon a band of Shoshone .
But Sacajawea recognized their chief , Cameahwait , as her long lost brother , and another Shoshone , Jumping Fish , as a girl she had not seen since the kidnapping .
For her services on the expedition , Sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , Charbonneau , received $ 500 .
Ariwite said the Lemhi 's best hope is to get a small bit of land from the federal government , which would be used as a Sacajawea interpretive center , and a home for some tribal members who have never felt welcome at Fort Hall .
Congress has been asked by Idaho elected officials to consider plans for a Sacajawea center here at Salmon , but not one that would be run by the Lemhi .
So you may be wondering , then , was it worth it ?

XIAMEN , September 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The International Finance Corporation -LRB- IFC -RRB- is willing to help China restructure its state-owned enterprises , the organization 's chief representative in China says .
In a discussion at an investment and trade fair here Monday , the company 's Davin Mackenzie said that IFC 's priority in China includes helping develop limited recourse financing , attracting world-class investors and technology to help develop internationally competitive industries , and helping establish non-state-owned commercial financial institutions to promote the development of China 's financial sector .
He also said that IFC will favor China 's inland areas in investment , and Sino-foreign joint ventures , joint stock companies most of whose stock is not held by the State , and fairly large rural and township enterprises with clear property rights .
`` The International Finance Corporation is very optimistic about China 's private enterprises , '' he said , adding that IFC is also willing to assist China 's new non-state-owned banks or to buy their stock .
Since China became a member and shareholder of IFC in 1980 , the international financial body has invested a total of 900 million US dollars in cement , glass , construction materials , chemicals , and automobile production , as well as in farm -produce processing and the capital market .

Church spokesman Father Brian Lucas said Friday it wants to test the claims of the Order of St . Charbel at a formal inquiry so it can distance itself from the order and its leader , know only as Mr . Kamm , or `` Little Pebble. ''
The inquiry would allow the church to make a `` definitive statement to Catholics and the public generally '' that church did not support the cult .

-LRB- NYT13 -RRB- SAN DIEGO -- Nov . 21 , 1999 -- CULT-AUCTION-2 , 11-21 -- A voluminous collection about UFO 's and a pair of black Nike sneakers similar to those worn by the 39 people whose bodies were found in the Heaven 's Gate house were among items auctioned off by county officials in San Diego on Saturday .
Williams denied an ex-member 's reported claim that Kamm ordered the digging of graves in preparation for a mass suicide .
The members call themselves the Yamassee Native American Nuwaubians and claim to have created a utopian society on their 476-acre compound of Egyptian -style architecture .
Members say they pay no dues and are free to come and go .
And they insist that suicide is not in their plans .
Leading up to Denver 's date with destiny , members of the sect , Concerned Christians , sold their cars , furniture and houses .
`` Kim has such control over this group , '' said Honsberger , who has talked to many concerned relatives of members .
During the summer , when members were getting passports in preparation for leaving the country , Miller arranged for three brothers who are members to marry three single women in the group , said Mark Roggeman , a Denver police officer who studies the group when he is off duty .
Roggeman , the police officer , said about 20 family members had received similarly vague messages in the last month .
-LRB- NYT12 -RRB- SAN DIEGO -- Nov . 21 , 1999 -- CULT-AUCTION-1 , 11-21 -- Bunk -bed frames that belonged to members of the Heaven 's Gate cult , were among items auctioned off in San Diego on Saturday .
And the proceeds from the Heaven 's Gate auction were designated to repay the families of the cult members for their burial expenses .
Will he tell him that the bed he 's going to sleep in was one in which a Heaven 's Gate member committed suicide , or will he keep it to himself as he sardonically chuckles off to his own bed , maybe one in which an aging George Washington might have had a continence problem ?
The criminologist said cults have the following characteristics : the group defies outside authority ; the leader and his followers fabricate and spread heresies ; members are brainwashed so as to be effectively controlled by the leader ; the leader make money illegally ; and the group and its philosophies endanger society .

While the letter has long been in the works , the bishops felt a special incentive to write it after a mass suicide during Easter week , 1997 .
Williams denied an ex-member 's reported claim that Kamm ordered the digging of graves in preparation for a mass suicide .
Lucas said Wilson did not consider Kamm 's visions authentic or that the activities of the order were consistent with Catholic practice .
The inquiry would allow the church to make a `` definitive statement to Catholics and the public generally '' that church did not support the cult .
He said the messages warned that people must atone for their sins or they would be destroyed on Judgment Day , which would occur sometime before the end of next year .
Asked to explain why it did n't happen , Williams said : `` It 's the Hale-Bopp comet , and the Virgin Mary gave us a date but not the year , just the day and the month .
Wingfield did not rule on the contempt charge against York .
And they insist that suicide is not in their plans .

At the Baath party conference , expected to last up to five days , about 1,000 delegates are to elect a 90 -person central committee , which will choose a new 21 -member national leadership .
The gathering , held a week after Assad died of a heart attack , began on a somber note , with Bashar Assad among about 1,000 delegates observing a minute 's silence after repeating the Baath party slogan : '' One Arab nation with an immortal mission. ''
The congress also elected 20 members to join Bashar on the party 's executive , the Baath 's most powerful policy-making body .
Bashar 's surprisingly swift ascendancy after Hafez Assad 's death June 10 -- within days he was declared commander of the armed forces and on Sunday named Baath Party chief -- was evidence of the legacy left by his father 's 30 years in power .
The party 's top brass and the state-controlled media speak of Syria 's democracy , but diplomats and analysts say the Baath has largely been used by the regime to create an illusion of popular political participation , while members -- 1.5 million -- use the party to win perks , advance their careers or attain coveted jobs .
Within hours of the death , the 250 -seat Baath -dominated parliament lowered the minimum age for president from 40 to 34 -- making Bashar eligible for the post .
The Baath Party has ruled Syria since 1963 .
Observers suggested they had been organized along the lines of the different government ministries , political youth organizations , and Baath Party districts .
In the days since his father 's death , the machinery of the all-important military and the ruling Baath Party , the main elements of his father 's authoritarian rule , have moved rapidly to elevate the young man .
Major military figures as well as some in the Baath Party were seated Tuesday on one side of the hall where Bashar Assad received visitors .
The party conference is part of an official script laid out for Bashar Assad , a political novice , to fill the vacuum left by the death of his father after 30 years at the helm of this Arab nation .
The party already has announced an initial nomination of Bashar Assad for president , and a formal nomination is expected to be announced during the conference .
The standing delegates then chanted the party anthem without music or applause .
It was unclear when during the five-day conference the party members would elect Bashar Assad to lead the party , or when they would nominate him for the presidency .
The proceedings were also to focus on assessing the party 's rule .
In an opening speech , Suleiman Qaddah , assistant secretary-general of the party , vowed it would remain loyal to Assad 's policies .
The party meeting was part of an official script laid out for Bashar Assad , a political novice , to fill the vacuum left by his father 's death June 10 after 30 years at the helm of the nation .
The 250 -seat parliament , where Baathists enjoy a clear majority , is expected to set a date for a presidential referendum in which Bashar is likely to be the only candidate .
the ideology and slogans of the party today remain relevant , '' he told the congress , the party 's first in 15 years .
The party reshuffle is part of a carefully laid out script to pass the leadership mantle to Bashar , a former eye doctor , and to ensure that the transition is smooth .
'' Absolute loyalty to Gen . Bashar Assad , leader of the march of the people and the party , '' read the front-page headline in Al-Baath , the party 's mouthpiece .
'' It is a heritage that must be revised and the new leadership must disassociate the party from the security agencies , which are the real tools of power in Syria , '' said Hassan Abu Taleb , a Syria expert with Egypt 's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies .
The party nominated him as their chief , and newspapers and the state propaganda machine began churning out editorials , posters and banners declaring Bashar the nation 's hope for the future .
A fourth party in the case -- former Premier Mahmoud el-Zoubi -- committed suicide May 21 as he was about to be served a judicial summons .
His party nominated him for president and is to confirm the nomination on June 17 at the first major party congress in nearly two decades .
In the last two years , the late president purged old timers from the military and the party who were likely to pose a threat to his son .

Instead , less than two hours after the public announcement of the president 's death , parliament amended the constitution to lower the age limit for the presidency from 40 to 34 .
Technically , the Syrian constitution provides for a vice president to take over if the presidency becomes vacant .
Bashar Assad 's imminent rise to the presidency of Syria could turn an idea many Arab leaders have nurtured for years into a precedent : grooming their sons to establish '' republican dynasties '' to ensure that power remains in the family after they 're gone .
Analysts are divided over whether Bashar 's ascension to the presidency would set a good example for the rest of the Arab world .
Mubarak has recently named Gamal , an economist , as a member of the general secretariat of his ruling National Democratic Party ; Gadhafi 's sons have been assuming larger public roles , standing in for their father at some public occasions ; Saleh 's son , Ahmed , is an army colonel and has been a parliament member since 1997 .

Hafez Assad received between 99.6 and 99.99 percent of the vote in his presidential referendums , which , like Monday 's , were orchestrated by the Baath party
Recovering the Golan Heights , the Syrian plateau that was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , is a top priority , Assad said .
`` However long it takes , this land is ours and it will return to us in full , '' he said .
Syrian - Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since mid-January , mainly over the future of a small strip of land that borders the Sea of Galilee , the major source of Israel 's water .
He pledged to reform the Syrian economy , which remains largely state-controlled and dependent on oil exports , by streamlining the government bureaucracy .
Syrian business owners , who have labored under a system with no private banks and strict controls on currency flows , have urged a major overhaul of the economic system .
Syrian newspapers , which are all run by the state , said he did not want to see his picture adorning every public and private building .
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad held two meetings with Lahoud on developing bilateral ties in all areas , the Syrian - Arab News Agency quoted presidential spokesman as saying .
They also insisted that the Syrian - Israeli and the Lebanese - Israeli tracks in the Middle East peace process can not be separated .

Where is Abu Nidal ?
A onetime guerrilla colleague , confronted with the question , replies with one of his own : Which Abu Nidal ?
The comment says much about Abu Nidal _ Arabic for `` father of struggle '' _ whom the United States once labeled the world 's most dangerous terrorist .
Over the years Abu Nidal has been reported to have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery .
The officials spoke on condition their names not be used , remaining as anonymous as the sources claiming Abu Nidal is in Egypt .
The reports persist because of Abu Nidal 's fame .
Palestinian officials have told The Associated Press that Abu Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _ is either jailed or hospitalized in Egypt .
But no one has offered definite proof that Abu Nidal is indeed in custody in Egypt .
One high-ranking Palestinian , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Wednesday that Abu Nidal was seized by the Egyptians about five weeks ago coming from Libya .
He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the Palestinian guerrilla to leave for medical reasons of if Abu Nidal 's own people were trying to smuggle him out through Egypt to another country .
Abu Nidal is near death and , though he is being treated in a hospital , he is in effect in detention , the official contended .
Over the years Abu Nidal is said to have operated out of Iraq , Syria and Libya .
It was a Palestinian in Lebanon who asked the question about `` which Abu Nidal , '' raising the theory that the famous terrorist actually is dead and that some followers have used his famous nom de guerre .
The Palestinian , once close to Abu Nidal 's group , spoke on condition of anonymity .
Over the years , the chain-smoking Abu Nidal has been reported to be dead of cancer or a heart attack .
I am Abu Nidal of flesh and blood ...
The comment says much about Abu Nidal , whom the United States once labeled the world 's most dangerous terrorist .
Over the years Abu Nidal , whose nickname is Arabic for `` father of struggle , '' has been reported to have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery .
Over the years , the chain-smoking Abu Nidal has been reported to have died of cancer or a heart attack .
A high-ranking Palestinian official said Wednesday that the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal has been detained in Egypt , but the country 's foreign minister denied the report .
The interest in Abu Nidal _ Arabic for `` father of struggle '' _ comes because of his notoriety for his daring attacks on Israelis and even Palestinians whom he opposed , and for the mystery surrounding him .
In recent days , several Palestinian officials insisting on anonymity have told news organizations , including The Associated Press , that Abu Nidal was either jailed or hospitalized with leukemia .
He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the 61-year-old Palestinian to leave or if Abu Nidal 's own people were trying to smuggle him out through Egypt to another country .
Abu Nidal is near death and being treated in a hospital , but is in effect in detention by Egyptian officials , the official contended .
He theorized Egypt is denying the arrest because it does not know what to do with Abu Nidal and fears revealing his arrest could make Egypt the target of anger by other terrorists .
He was asked about reports Tuesday and Wednesday by American newspapers and broadcasters which quoted U.S . and Arab officials as saying Abu Nidal had been arrested by Egyptian police .
`` Abu Nidal is not in Egypt , '' Moussa replied .
In Washington , the State Department 's intelligence and counterterrorism offices could not confirm reports of Abu Nidal 's arrest .
Abu Nidal 's group has been listed by the U.S . State Department as `` the most dangerous terrorist organization . ''
However , most of the incidents blamed on Abu Nidal occurred years ago , and he is now believed to have only a few hundred followers , mostly in Lebanon .
LONDON _ One of the world 's most wanted terrorists , the Palestinian guerrilla chief , Sabri al-Banna , better known as Abu Nidal , is being held by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo , according to an Arab intelligence official .
Abu Nidal , 61 , is accused by Washington of having killed or injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974 .
The Arab intelligence official , who spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity , said Abu Nidal was arrested two months ago in Egypt but had actually been there for nine months .
The official said Egyptian intelligence agents wanted to use Abu Nidal 's network to target terrorist groups planning bombings and assassinations in Egypt .
At that point , according to the official , Abu Nidal stopped cooperating and was arrested .
Last week , Egyptian officials denied that Abu Nidal was on Egyptian territory after two Arabic newspapers asserted he was under arrest in Egypt .
Officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization , a main target of Abu Nidal , who has accused the group of betraying the Palestinian cause by negotiating peace with Israel , said Egypt would not confirm these reports to them , but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken place .
Al Sharq al-Awsat reported on Aug . 23 that Abu Nidal was dying of cancer in an Egyptian hospital .
The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Abu Nidal had been arrested by Egyptian authorities as he crossed into Egypt from Libya .
Abu Nidal , whose name means ` 'Father of Struggle '' is the founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council which has claimed lethal attacks around the world , mostly against Israelis and PLO partisans , but also against Jews in Western Europe and moderate Arab states .
Although the Abu Nidal group is smaller now than it had been in the past , it continues to have adherents in Lebanon , Syria , Libya , Iraq and according to intelligence officials several dormant cells in Europe .
Abu Nidal is wanted in Italy , the United States , the United Kingdom .
Moussa was telling reporters here in response to some media reports in the last couple of weeks that the 61-year-old man , who is known by his nom de guerre as Abu Nidal , is in Egypt .
Abu Nidal , operating from Iraq , Syria and Libya , was blamed for masterminding the bombing of two American airliners : a Pan Am on the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in the air over the Aegean sea in 1974 .

The review , which will be narrower than the full-scale reopening of the case sought by King 's family , will focus on claims like one by Donald Wilson , a retired FBI agent , who said that after the killing he found paper in Ray 's car that bore the name Raoul .
That was the name of the shadowy figure who Ray , after recanting his confession , claimed had manipulated him into the plot .

He is wanted in the United States , Great Britain and Italy and was condemned to death by the Palestine Liberation Organization , from which he broke in 1972 .
Over the years , reports of his death , often spun by the man himself , have circulated widely .
The official 's account could not be independently confirmed , but it was supported on some points by a PLO official .
Abu Nidal , whose name means ` 'Father of Struggle '' is the founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council which has claimed lethal attacks around the world , mostly against Israelis and PLO partisans , but also against Jews in Western Europe and moderate Arab states .
Over the past decade he included the PLO among his targets having taken responsibility for killing some the organization 's top leaders .
PLO officials said Egypt would not confirm these reports to them , but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken place .

In Washington on Tuesday , Thomas Pickering , undersecretary of state , said he did not have `` any determinative information '' to provide on the reported arrest , and said questions should be addressed to the Egyptian government .

Klein lived under a false name in the Norman village of Sainte-Honorine-la-Guillaume until his arrest under an old warrant .
Germany is interested not only in what Klein might have to say about Carlos ' terror network , but also about activities at the time of the Stasi , the East German secret police .
French investigators ended a five-day visit to Bucharest , where they studied possible links between the revolutionary known as `` Carlos the Jackal '' and Romania 's communist -era secret police , the French Embassy said Monday . Investigators , led by anti-terrorism Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere , analyzed a series of archived documents of the communist government and met former communist officials between Tuesday and Saturday , the daily Cronica Romana reported Monday .
The international terrorist known as `` Carlos the Jackal '' was charged with crimes against humanity in Romania , and an open bank account was found in his name , a military prosecutor said Monday . `` The network of Carlos ' collaborators may still be active in Romania , '' national television quoted Gen . Dan Voinea as saying .
`` The German secret service told us Carlos rented a car in Germany using false documents provided by Romania , '' Voinea said .
After a four-year trial , an accused terrorist and a former accomplice of Carlos the Jackal will be sentenced next week in a bombing attack on a French cultural center , a Berlin court said Monday .
Germany 's longest-sought fugitive until his 1995 arrest in Yemen , Weinrich is a former Red Army Faction member who also headed European operations for international terrorist Carlos the Jackal in the 1970s and '80s .
Prosecutors say the Berlin bombing was one in a series of unsuccessful attempts to pressure France to free Carlos ' lover and another member of his terrorist gang from a French prison .

Relatives of the man known as Carlos the Jackal have praised a letter of solidarity sent to the convicted terrorist by Venezuela 's president .
`` Chavez is almost a mythical figure , '' said Carlos Sabino , a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela and longtime observer of the country 's politics .
Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born in Sabaneta de Barinas , a small town in the vast , sparsely-populated savannah that is Venezuela 's equivalent of the Great Plains .
Born to a poor family in the western interior city of Barinas , Chavez 's first dreams were about the major leagues .

The plutonium-powered Cassini spacecraft remained in contact with its operations team .
Program Manager Bob Mitchell said engineering data from the spacecraft are being transmitted to Earth to help engineers pinpoint what caused Cassini to enter the safe mode .
JPL said engineers suspect that during a tracking maneuver , Cassini 's star scanner may have viewed a patch of sky without the bright stars the spacecraft uses to orient itself in space .
Mitchell said he expects Cassini will be taken out of safe mode later this week after the problem has been identified and data thoroughly analyzed .
It passed Venus last year and this year will use Venus again and then swoop within 500 miles of Earth , an encounter that also worries Cassini opponents .
Cassini 's return , two years after NASA launched the largest and most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever , poses virtually no risk , mission officials say .
The plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter twice swung by Earth in the early 1990s at altitudes much lower than Cassini 's closest point .
The chances of an accidental re-entry of Cassini are about 1 in 1.2 million , according to a NASA estimate .
`` It 's just not a credible event , '' said Bob Mitchell , Cassini 's program manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena .
A handful of anti- Cassini Web sites also have been set up .
The plutonium-powered Cassini spacecraft flew within 728 miles of Earth 's surface , successfully using the planet 's gravity to gain speed and change direction for the final stretch of its journey to Saturn .
`` It was right by the book , '' said Bob Mitchell , Cassini 's program manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena .
But concern over the safety of nuclear-powered spacecraft are not likely to diminish as the $ 3.4 billion Cassini speeds away .
Activists had feared that human error or some other mishap could fling Cassini and its 72 pounds of radioactive plutonium into Earth 's atmosphere .
Before Cassini 's launch , protesters filed lawsuits and threatened to chain themselves to the pad .
Cassini does n't use the plutonium for propulsion but to power its dozen instruments .
Once it arrives at Saturn , Cassini will make close-up studies of the planet , its rings , moons and magnetic environment .
Cassini 's two RTGs have been feeding it electrical power steadily and should continue to work long after the spacecraft loops into orbit around Saturn in 2004 .
CASSINI 'S CRUCIAL COURSE
The Cassini spacecraft has made the second of its two flybys of Venus , using the planet 's gravity to pick up speed on its way to Saturn , which it should reach in 2004 .
The next planet to provide a shot of energy to the spacecraft is Earth , which Cassini will approach next month .
Cassini is carrying 72 pounds of plutonium in a generator to provide heat and power -LRB- the solar cells that are used by many spacecraft would be impractical in the outer reaches of the solar system , so far from the Sun -RRB- .
</A>
<A 50.2 >
Not only did the craft 's considerable heft force an impressively circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three heavenly bodies , but its $ 2 billion cost clashed ominously with the U.S . space agency 's shrinking budget .
Once they reach their target , they will seek out raw materials , build sensors and an antenna , then relay images back home .
No more behemoths that cost many billions of dollars apiece would be built to explore outer space .
Instead , he vowed to tap American ingenuity to build swarms of small but powerful spacecraft that would probe the heavens , sending back a nearly constant stream of new information .
`` There 's a balance between science return , acceptance of risk and cost reduction , '' he said .
`` Those have gotten out of balance , with too much emphasis on cost reduction .
But the idea of doing missions more rapidly and at lower cost certainly is still valid .
The issue is how rapidly and how much cost reduction. ''

The Cassini space probe , due to be launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida of the United States tomorrow , has a 32 kilogram plutonium fuel payload to power its seven year journey to Venus and Saturn .
The Cassini space probe , due to be launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida of the United States at dawn , is carrying 33 kg of plutonium needed to power its seven-year journey to Venus and Saturn .
Nearly seven meters in height , Cassini will be carrying 12 separate packages of scientific instruments , as well as a probe , carrying six more bundles of sensors , which is to be dropped on to Titan , Saturn 's largest moon .
Among the instruments on Cassini are cameras to provide pictures of Saturn , its rings and moons , and radar to pierce the orange , hydrocarbon haze surrounding Titan .
WASHINGTON , October 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The U.S . National Aeronautics and Space Administration -LRB- NASA -RRB- today decided to delay the launch of its Saturn probe , Cassini , due to strong wind and technical problems .

They also provoked the Turkish army into attacks that nearly obliterated Kurdish towns _ and in many cases turned Kurds against the PKK .
He is not even the god of the Turkish Kurds , most of whom , despite poverty and government attempts to suppress their identity , reject the PKK 's violent methods that have killed about 37,000 people in Turkey and brought the devastating force of the Turkish military crashing down on Kurdish towns in southeastern Turkey .
The violent protests by Kurds across Europe gives the impression that the protesters must all be members of the PKK or that Ocalan is a leader to all Kurds .
The Kurds are also protesting the repressive political , social , economic and military conditions that exist in Turkey and which continue to smear Turkey 's human rights record .
If that 's not enough , the Kurds are also using Ocalan 's capture to inform the world that all 25 million of them remain stateless .
Divided by the states where they live , by tribal and political allegiances that make them willing and unwilling pawns in regional and international affairs , the Kurds are as complex as the region where most of them live .
I also lived for weeks at a time _ in 1991 , 1992 and 1996 _ with Kurds in Syria , Iraq and Turkey .
Saddam Hussein drove the Iraqi Kurds from northern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991 , but that was not the PKK 's war .
Turkish soldiers would kill any Kurds who tried to cross from Iraq into Turkey .
In the early 1990s , I located what Syrian Kurds told me was Ocalan 's refuge in Damascus , but I was never able to spot him there .
About 2 million Kurds live in northeastern Syria near its border with Turkey and Iraq , but the Kurdish military presence there centered mainly around Kurds from Iraq , not Turkey .
No friend of Saddam Hussein , Syria opened its border with Iraq in a vain attempt to help the Iraqi Kurds resist him after the Gulf War .
I have interviewed Jalil Talabani , Massoud Barzani and Sami Abdul Rahman , the main tribal leaders of the Iraqi Kurds , and listened to each attempt to delude the world , and probably themselves , into believing that a victory against Saddam Hussein was just around the next mountain when a rout awaited them in a nearby valley .
Now his capture gives Ocalan the stature among other Kurds he never had before .
There are Shiite Muslims , Christians , Armenians and Kurds .

The arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in Rome has sparked protests by Kurds throughout Europe .
Some of the key issues involved in the Kurdish conflict : Q : Who are the Kurds and how many are there ?
A : There are an estimated 20- to 25 million Kurds spread out in four countries _ Turkey , Syria , Iran and Iraq .
Kurds share a common language , related to Iran 's Farsi , and are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims .
Q : What is the legal status of Kurds in Turkey ?
A : Kurds are not recognized as a minority , unlike the Greeks , Armenians , Assyrians and Jews .
Q : What rights do Kurds have in Turkey ?
A : Turkey 's last military government banned the use of Kurdish in 1983 , but Kurdish was legalized in unofficial settings in 1991 .
A : Kurds were promised an independent homeland in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres , which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire .
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the founder of modern Turkey , fought to regain the land .
Originally fighting for independence , the group now says it aims for equal rights for Kurds and an autonomous Kurdish state or a federation with Turkey .
The PKK has waged a guerrilla war in the southeastern mountains and carried out militant attacks in western Turkey and Germany .
Q : What 's Turkey 's answer to accusations of discrimination against Kurds ?
A : Turkey insists there is no division between Turks and Kurds in society .
Authorities point to success stories of Kurds , including late President Turgut Ozal and current parliamentary speaker , Hikmet Cetin .
Communist lawmakers revealed Wednesday that they had escorted the fugitive chief of Turkey 's Kurdish rebels to Italy in his search for haven , defending a venture that has sparked boycotts , hunger strikes and international ill will as a way of making Europe confront the Kurdish problem .
Mantovani insisted the idea of seeking asylum in Italy was all Ocalan 's but acknowledged he had assured Ocalan that Italian law would bar his extradition to Turkey .
A Rome court freed him after a week , rejecting Turkey 's arrest warrant under Italian law forbidding extradition of suspects who face a possible death penalty , as Ocalan does in Turkey .
Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK , which has waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey .
Kurds in cities across Europe protested his arrest with marches , sit-ins , hunger strikes , self-immolations and a suicide bombing .
The people of Turkey protested with almost equal fervor when Italy freed Ocalan , burning Italian clothes and cars and launching boycotts that brought threats of European Union sanctions against Turkey .
`` We were just helping the Kurds find a way to start peace talks .
Granting Ocalan asylum would further enrage Turkey , a NATO ally and major trading partner , as well as the United States , which wants him prosecuted .
The Kurds were promised an independent homeland in 1920 after the Ottoman Empire collapsed but the international community abandoned the idea in 1923 .
In Turkey , they are not recognized as an official minority ; the use of the Kurdish language is banned in education and broadcasting .
Ocalan said Wednesday that his decision to abandon armed struggle and use Europe as a platform for peaceful resolution to Kurds ' complaints was `` irreversible. ''
Ocalan was willing to stand trial , the lawyers said _ but not in Turkey or Germany .
Kurds continued to press for the release of Abdullah Ocalan , who now seeks a political solution with Turkey .
Fearing unrest among Germany 's many Turkish Kurds , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Friday ruled out seeking Ocalan 's extradition on murder and terror charges .
Schroeder noted that Germany has more Turkish Kurds than any other European Union nation _ about a quarter of its 2 million Turkish nationals are Kurdish _ and said he was acting to `` protect the peace '' by not bringing Ocalan here for trial .
Even as the politicians met in Bonn , 11,000 Turkish Kurds rallied nearby to support the rebel leader .
Some beat drums and carried photographs of Ocalan , whose outlawed Kurdish Workers Party , or PKK , has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey .
After the meeting , Schroeder said Germany and Italy will work with Turkey to help it resolve the question of Kurdish autonomy at home .
`` We want a friendly , normal relations with Turkey , '' the chancellor said .
Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges in Turkey , where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested Nov . 12 when he arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow .
The decision enraged many in Turkey who consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal .
PKK responsibility would discredit Ocalan 's announcement this month that the rebels would now use only peaceful means to advance the cause of Turkey 's Kurds .
The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany , Mehmet Tanriverdi , has asked the German government to help reach a political settlement in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy .
With what seemed like extraordinary coordination , Kurds in Paris , Moscow , London , Frankfurt , Milan , Bern and more than a dozen other cities went on rampages of rage and protest over the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan , leader of the Kurdish Workers Party .
By the end of the day , many hundreds of Kurds had been arrested and some of the hostages _ but not all _ had been released .
At least three Kurds in European cities had set themselves on fire , including a 17-year-old girl in Germany , who like the others was seriously injured .
The Kurds in Europe did not focus their anger on Turkey , which captured Ocalan in Nairobi , Kenya , late on Monday .
In Istanbul , Turkey , about 1,000 Kurds marched through a Kurdish neighborhood , setting cars on fire .
But there were also demonstrations of joy in Turkey by other Turks , who view Ocalan as a terrorist .
There are more than 20 million Kurds in Turkey and nearby countries , who have long suffered persecution by successive governments of countries in which they live .
Ocalan has led a 14-year often-violent guerrilla movement for Kurdish self-rule and civil rights in Turkey , which has been met with violent repression by the government .
The streets of Athens were relatively quiet on Tuesday , perhaps because Greek police rounded up more than 350 Kurds preemptively early in the morning and held them in an abandoned army camp .
In the evening , under tight security , a rally of Greeks and Kurds in support of Ocalan took place in downtown Athens without incident .
In the Netherlands , where Ocalan had hoped to go after leaving Kenya , by some reports , about 150 Kurds stormed the Greek ambassador 's residence in the Hague about 5 a.m . and took three hostages , including the ambassador 's wife and their 8-year-old son .
`` These attacks were n't really organized , '' said Mehmet Atac , a 28-year-old Kurd who was among several hundred who stood vigil outside the Greek consulate in Frankfurt this afternoon after Kurds occupied it .
`` We will stay here until we get some answers from the Greek authorities , '' one of the Kurds occupying the Greek Embassy in London told a British radio station .
Another of the Kurds inside the embassy , who gave his name only as Ofter , told reporters by telephone : `` We are completely committed .
About 500,000 Kurds live in Germany , including 10,000 in Frankfurt .
Otto Schily , the German interior minister , pleaded with the Kurds to leave the various consulates peacefully .
Police in Frankfurt used truncheons and water cannons to subdue Kurds who were turning over cars .
`` This is a matter that only affects the countries involved _ those that extradited him and Turkey , '' he said .
For months , Ocalan had appealed to European countries for political asylum or an international trial that would allow him to avoid being deported to Turkey , where he could face the death penalty .
Turkey applied intense pressure , and Syria , Russia and finally Italy expelled him .
Kurds share a common language , related to Iran 's Farsi , and many are Muslims .
Kurds were promised a homeland in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres , which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire .
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the founder of modern Turkey , fought to regain the land , destroying plans for a Kurdish state .
In Turkey , Kurds are not recognized as a minority .
A ban imposed by Turkey 's last military government on the use of Kurdish in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991 , but Kurdish is illegal in broadcasts and in educational or political settings .
A court case to ban Turkey 's main pro- Kurdish party is under way .
On Tuesday , as 30 protesters surrendered four hours after storming the Greek consulate in Milan , Italy , and holding six people hostage , including the consul , the Italian government implored Turkey to give Ocalan a fair trial .
Italy had refused to extradite him to Turkey last November , citing a law that bans Italy from extraditing prisoners to countries that use capital punishment .
Walter Veltroni , leader of the largest party in Italy 's center-left government , warned Turkey on Tuesday not to apply the death penalty , saying , `` That would place Turkey irretrievably outside Europe . ''
With what seemed like extraordinary coordination , Kurds in Paris , Moscow , London , Frankfurt , Milan , Bern and more than a dozen other cities as far away as Sydney went on rampages of rage and protest over the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan , leader of the Kurdish Workers Party .
Although there was no clear evidence that the protests were orchestrated , Kurds held rallies , seized consulates , battled police and threatened mass suicides .
By the end of the day , many hundreds of Kurds had been arrested , and most of the almost two dozen hostages had been released .
Kurds share a common language , related to Persian , and many are Muslims .
ANKARA , Turkey _ The emotions of 25 million people without a state seized the world 's television screens last week .
The Kurds want self-determination , but no one else seems ready to take up their cause .
They are Muslim farmers , merchants and nomads -- scattered across Turkey , Iraq , Iran and Syria .
With `` no friend but the mountains , '' as their self-pitying legend goes , the Kurds have long been cloaked in relative obscurity .
The arrest Feb . 16 of separatist leader Abdullah `` Apo '' Ocalan by Turkey -- with the help of the CIA -- provoked riots by the Kurdish diaspora across Europe and brought the quest for self-rule into the world 's living rooms , with TV pictures of Kurds taking over embassies , wrestling with police and committing self-immolation .
`` And clearly it is not only Turkey 's problem , but the world 's , '' said Sedat Yurtdas , 38 , a moderate Kurdish politician and lawyer whose activities have been banned by the Turkish government .
The Entebbe -style capture of Ocalan in Kenya by Turkish commandos was widely celebrated in Turkey , comparable to if Israel had nabbed Yasser Arafat amid the Palestinian terrorist movement in the 1970s .
He is routinely referred to in Turkey 's pro-government press as `` the babykiller. ''
Still , the question nagging Turkey is : What next ?
The guerrilla movement is still active , there are millions of Kurds living in Europe .
A sobering problem for Turkey is the delicate matter of how to handle Ocalan 's upcoming trial and anticipated conviction , after which he could be sentenced to death .
Ocalan and the PKK 's brutal tactics have been loathed by many moderate Kurds .
But Turkey risks turning Ocalan into a martyr for all Kurds if the trial is viewed as a sham and Ocalan is put to death .
In the immediate aftermath of Ocalan 's arrest , Kurds living abroad and linked by e-mail and a Europe -based satellite TV station , took the streets and occupied embassy buildings in more than 20 European cities .
Only one other man has done as much to publicize the plight of the Kurds .
A vindictive Saddam Hussein sought to annihilate Iraqi Kurds in the north of his country in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War .
With American and United Nations help , the Kurds in northern Iraq are largely running their own affairs , without realizing their ultimate goal of sovereignty .
Even the most militant of Kurds began to set their sights lower ; In Turkey , Ocalan relinquished the goal of an independent statehood , calling instead for limited autonomy within Turkey 's borders .
With the bulk of Kurds living in Turkey , the United States has been hesitant to enter the fray and risk upsetting Turkey , a NATO ally strategically situated next to Iran and Iraq that hosts the U.S . military most notably at the large Air Force base at Incerlik .
On Friday , the State Department acknowledged that the U.S . intelligence services helped Turkey track down and capture Ocalan , who had looking for a hiding place since mid-October when he was forced from his haven in Syria .
Turkey used the arrest as an opportunity to launch a fresh offensive against the Kurds in the southeast , where troops backed by artillery and air power routinely drive the guerrillas into the snow-covered highlands across the border with Iraq .
If Turkey 's relentless military and security offensive is the stick , Ecevit offered a carrot this week in proclaiming a campaign to increase investment and improve roads in mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey .
Undoubtedly , the Kurds will be looking for more .
But Turkey 's chief prosecutor has begun legal proceedings to bar the pro- Kurdish People 's Democracy Party -LRB- HADEP -RRB- .
If outlawed , it would be the fourth political party sympathetic to the Kurds to be banned in Turkey during this decade .
A few public figures in Turkey do openly question government policy , at the risk of prosecution for violating security laws , by suggesting that the Kurdish problem could have been preempted years ago had Turkey relaxed its opposition to limited regional self-rule for the Kurds and allowed Kurdish moderates a greater voice in national affairs .
`` The arrest has placed the eyes of the world on Turkey .
It is an important test , not only for the future of the Kurds but for Turkey 's reputation in the world , '' he said .
Turkey can take comfort in the fact that during his months on the run , no European country would offer Ocalan refuge .
But now that it has him in custody , the government here appears to be ignoring demands by international human rights groups for greater tolerance towards the Kurds and a fair trial for Ocalan .
Turkey is preparing a closed trial before a military tribunal for the rebel leader and has rejected attempts of Ocalan 's European lawyers to enter the country to confer with him .
Back in Turkey , the threat of new violence was faxed Friday to the Associated Press .
Ocalan 's PKK warned that Turkey would `` face the consequences '' if Ocalan were harmed .
`` If Turkey has a genuine intention to solve this problem peacefully , it is high time to do it now .
There would be no reason for Kurds to rebel if we were allowed to be part of the system. ''

Although the process costs more , says the company with 9 billion U.S . dollars sales last year , the prices are not going to rise as increased business should cover the increased cost .
Under pressure from restaurant owners , Burger King said Tuesday it 's not for sale and believes that most franchisees are confident about a $ 500 million plan to help revitalize the brand .
The National Franchisee Association Inc . , an organization of Burger King franchise holders , said Monday it is exploring the idea of spinning the company off from British parent Diageo PLC .
The group denied it was seeking to buy Burger King , however .
'' The franchisee group has not made an offer to purchase Burger King Corp . from Diageo nor does it plan to , '' the association said in a release .
Burger King Corp . responded Tuesday with a statement from chief executive officer Dennis Malamatinas , who said , '' Diageo is completely confident in BKC 's vision for reshaping the brand and believes that the majority of franchisees are as well. ''
Franchisees have complained of slim profit margins , ineffective marketing campaigns and lack of leadership at a time of slow U.S . sales growth .
In a Feb . 26 letter to the company that was obtained by Dow Jones Newswires , franchisee association president Steven M . Lewis alluded to '' the weakened state of the Burger King brand and inadequate franchisee support by Burger King Corp . ''
To franchisees , Burger King 's subsidiary status in Diageo is a predicament , especially compared with McDonald 's Corp . 's standalone position atop the fast-food industry , said Brian Eisenharth , a Diageo stock analyst with Collins & Co . in San Francisco .
'' The problem is that Burger King is only a piece of what Diageo 's doing , and to the Burger King franchisees that 's all that they 're concerned about , '' Eisenharth said .
Burger King plans to offer details of its '' transformation initiatives '' Wednesday at a franchise meeting in Orlando , and Diageo plans to meet with franchise officials May 26 .
Burger King is the world 's second -largest hamburger chain , behind McDonald 's Corp . , with some 10,900 Burger King restaurants worldwide .
Of Burger King 's 8,160 U.S . restaurants , 94 percent of them are franchise-owned .

Moving to improve its image , food and sales , Burger King Corp . said Wednesday that it would overhaul its 10,000 restaurants with new kitchens , modifications to drive-through windows and elaborate redesigns of the buildings and the company logo .
The flame -broiled concept will remain , but customers can say goodbye to those boxy structures huddling in the middle of the shopping mall or along the interstate that have long meant Burger King .
It has spunkier lettering , and its burger image has been manicured to make its bun look more like the kind of bread used for panini ; a blue crescent swooshes around three-quarters of the image .
The changes , regarded as among the most extensive in the ultracompetitive industry , were announced to franchisees Wednesday in Reno , where Burger King is having an annual business meeting .
While McDonald 's Corp . reconfigured its kitchens last year to improve the way its food tastes , the steps that Burger King is taking are seen as going well beyond that .
The ultimate success is going to depend on the cost of the building and the sales generated from that building . ''
The average Burger King now rings up about $ 1.1 million in sales a year , the company said .
Burger King has been inching forward over the last several years and gaining market share , company executives said , and the changes announced Wednesday are supposed to continue that trend .
`` We have a lot of momentum , but all along the way we 've known that in order to continue our momentum , there were certain things consumers were telling us about our brand that we needed to do , '' said Paul Clayton , president of Burger King 's North American division .
Among the changes that customers demanded , he added , were `` less stress at the drive-through , '' where about 60 percent of Burger King 's sales are made .
The look of many Burger King restaurants was also a concern , he added .
Also Wednesday , Burger King said it had signed a new 10-year contract with Coca-Cola Co . to provide soft-drink fountain service at its restaurants .
`` We believe our agreement is going to create many , many opportunities for profitable growth for Coca-Cola and for Burger King by building their soft-drink business , '' said a Coca-Cola spokeswoman , Polly Howes .
`` Coke is making one more bizarre investment that their shareholders are never going to see a return on , '' said the spokesman , Jeff Brown , who estimated that whatever concessions Coca-Cola made to Burger King would have to be matched at McDonald 's as well .
Still , he added , `` having a big fountain account like Burger King provides a benefit over and above the sale of products. ''
Dr Pepper/Seven Up Co . , a division of Cadbury Schweppes , also won a contract to install one spigot serving Dr Pepper in every Burger King in the United States .
LOS ANGELES , December 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Burger King , America 's No . 2 fast-food chain , has rolled out an improved kind of french fries to bite on the market share of McDonald 's , the No . 1 .
The new slivers of potato fried in hot oil are thicker , crisper and stay hotter longer , or long enough to survive the four -block walk to the office without going cold and limp , Burger King claims .
As the largest chain of the kind , in and outside the United States , McDonald 's has 21,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries , with a total sales of 31.8 billion dollars last year .

It 's no surprise , then , that Newhouse has decided to merge the magazine into his Conde Nast empire .
Next year , the The New Yorker 's sinecured staffers will move into Conde
Nast 's new headquarters and will fight for phone lines and desk space with the rest of Si 's magazines .
NEW YORK _ It was the closest you could get to a debutante party in the mud-slinging , ego-bruising , advertising-hungry world of magazine publishing .
's newest joint venture _ who sat , smiles firmly in place , at a table behind Ms . Black , in their first public appearance as affianced partners of the Hearst company .
The company 's two other joint ventures , Smart Money -LRB- which is published in conjunction with Dow Jones & Co .
-RRB- and Marie Claire -LRB- with Marie Claire Album , a French company -RRB- are two of the strongest titles in the industry .
But not all eyes will remain glued to Talk ; many will be monitoring Ms . Black 's progress in changing the company to increase advertising revenue .
Hearst 's $ 1-billion -a-year magazine division _ which publishes 19 titles in the United States , including Cosmopolitan , Popular Mechanics and Good Housekeeping _ has long been considered the most middle of the road , least daring of the four major magazine companies , as compared with the stylish Conde Nast , the mainstream but news-oriented Time Inc . and the scrappy , growing Hachette Filipacchi Magazines .
Ms . Black has changed the company slowly ; in three years , she has fired or reassigned only a handful of publishers and editors .
-LRB- By contrast , when Steven T . Florio , the chief executive of Conde Nast , was named publisher of the company , the magazine division of Advance Publications , he made dozens of personnel changes in the first months . -RRB-
She has concentrated on rehabilitating the magazine company 's image among advertisers , who had grumbled loudly in 1995 when Hearst cut its magazines ' guaranteed circulation rates .
She has maintained Cosmopolitan 's status as a market leader , despite high-level editorial changes , and it routinely pummels its arch rival , Conde Nast 's Glamour _ now edited by former Cosmopolitan editor Bonnie Fuller _ at the newsstand , a success that must be sweet for Ms . Black .
In December _ in another advertiser -oriented move _ she restructured the company 's magazines into two groups , in an attempt to encourage advertisers to buy pages in several magazines at once , in effect offering package deals .
Like her company , Ms . Black is frill-free .
Hearst is a privately held company , and Ms . Black will not discuss numbers , even good ones , choosing instead to highlight the successes of Smart Money and Cosmopolitan .
At Conde Nast , they love to toss the thing around .
Former Hearst editors say the company 's culture is not directed toward creative tinkering .
`` At Conde Nast , editors are treated like entertainment impresarios .
At Hearst , they 're expected to put on green eyeshades and sign expense vouchers from the photo department , '' said Randall Rothenberg , an editor at Wired , which is owned by Conde Nast , and a former executive editor at Esquire , which is owned by Hearst .
While the Talk deal is a change of tactics for Hearst , it signals a shift for the magazine industry in general as more companies move toward joint ventures in a publishing economy that feels increasingly unsure .
E . Daniel Capell , an authority on magazine circulation and the editor of Capell 's Circulation Report , said that joint ventures are very appealing , especially to a company like Hearst .

The venerable literary and current affairs magazine was the last of 14 publications to make the move to the $ 500 million , 48 -story Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square -- a structure already noted for a troubled construction history that cost at least two lives and forced the shutdown of a hit Broadway musical .
The New Yorker , which had moved once before , in 1991 , joins such publications as Vanity Fair , Vogue , Glamour , GQ , House and Garden and Allure , most of which moved from the former Conde Nast building on Madison Avenue .
Three of the company 's publications , Wired , Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit , are based in California but have business offices at 4 Times Square , Ms . Perl said .
NEW YORK _ With the coordination of an invading army , Conde Nast has begun moving its glossy fashion magazines into a new home at 4 Times Square , the first skyscraper built in New York City since 1992 .
Since Conde Nast signed a deal for the building nearly three years ago , Times Square has become one of the most sought-after commercial neighborhoods in the city .
Reuters recently started work on its new headquarters across from 4 Times Square , and Ernst & Young , the accounting firm , is close to a deal to build its own tower nearby .
Conde Nast will be moving from its old-money environs on the East Side , within easy reach of Brooks Brothers , Paul Stuart and Patroon , to the hurly-burly of Times Square .
It was Douglas Durst , the developer of 4 Times Square , who persuaded Conde Nast to make the move .
Truman , the editorial director , said Conde Nast had a choice of either leaving its longtime home on Madison Avenue for a year while the space there was renovated , or moving permanently to a new building .
NEW YORK _ In 1995 , Anna Wintour , the editor in chief of Vogue magazine , fixed her sphinx-like gaze upon her boss , S.I . Newhouse Jr . , the chairman of Conde Nast , and exhorted him in front of a room full of Conde Nast publishing executives to buy Fairchild Publications .
Drew Schutte , who 's been with the magazine since 1994 , ascended to the publisher 's post but is based in New York , home of Wired parent Conde Nast .
`` The whole thing was to engage women and get them to take action , '' said Cara Deoul Perl , the vice president for creative marketing at Conde Nast in New York , a unit of Advance Publications .
`` And the company was not madly for Adlai .
And over the next two months , they will be joined by 400 more truckloads of equipment and 1,800 colleagues from Vanity Fair , Allure , Glamour , Self , GQ , The New Yorker and the other magazines that make up the Conde Nast empire .
Newhouse averaged half that figure , although he pulled out all the stops when it came to the company 's cafeteria , where , executives said , spending exceeded $ 400 a square foot .
The company chose to bring the magazines , scattered among six buildings , into the same tower .
Instead of giving all the window space to ranking executives , the company has decided to let many employees labor at metallic blue workstations near the windows .
are the envy of the company , brought in his own architect , Basil Walter , to insure that his new space will look exactly like his old office , which was renovated by the same designer four years ago .
The company had just been bought by Walt Disney Co . as part of the Capital Cities acquisition , and Disney did not seem a natural fit .
But on Friday , the fashion , advertising and magazine publishing industries hummed with the news that Newhouse , whose company publishes Vogue , Glamour , Mademoiselle , Vanity Fair , The New Yorker and a dozen other sleek and stylish magazines , had offered $ 650 million for Fairchild , the publisher of Women 's Wear Daily , W and Jane magazines .
`` So people are concerned about the fact that all of a sudden the editorial influence that drives what is on the shelf and what sells in the stores is in the hands of one company , that the business power in the fashion industry is now in the hands of the Newhouses .
Kenneth Cole , whose footwear and clothing company earned $ 218 million in revenue in 1998 , said the situation resembled a kind of monopoly on style .
Uptown at Elle 's publishers , Hachette-Filipacchi , Jack Kliger , the company 's chief executive , said he was glad his offers to Disney had been rebuffed , because the final price tag for Fairchild , under the stewardship of Patrick McCarthy , was unreasonably high .
Advertisers such as Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole have found it `` easy to add Wired to the plan '' of other Conde Nast buys , such as Vanity Fair , the New Yorker , Vogue and GQ .
He has some other tricks up his sleeve as well : In July , Digimarc , an Oregon company , will give special PC devices to 25,000 Wired subscribers .
In October , a company called Digital Convergence will send similarly equipped laser `` pens '' that link to the PC to every Wired subscriber , so that they can read bar codes and launch Web sites .
Meanwhile , Schutte 's old boss Lyon is working feverishly to start her new company , One Ventures , which will produce a magazine and Web site devoted to all things design this fall .
Magazine , will be editor in chief of the San Francisco company .

That 1998 agreement stated that paramilitary groups should finish disarming by this May , but it set no date for the process to begin .
London and Dublin are struggling to find ways of reviving the political institutions by May 22 , which the 1998 agreement set as the date for a completion of an arms handover .
He added : `` There is no credible alternative to the Good Friday Agreement .
In a letter to the Huntingdon Conservative Association , the 56-year-old Major said he had made his decision after '' a great deal of soul-searching and sadness. ''
That agreement designed the local power-sharing government that gave the province partial home rule briefly this winter .
and for his tireless efforts and determination to bring peace to Northern Ireland which laid the foundations for the Good Friday Agreement , '' Hague said .
But the two parties most crucial to the deal _ the Ulster Unionists who represent most Protestants , and Sinn Fein , the political allies of the Irish Republican Army _ signed up to the agreement without so much as exchanging a word with each other .
Unionists refused to form a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein , called for under the agreement , until the IRA turned in its weapons .
`` There was an agreement , but there was no trust , '' Mitchell said .
At the very moment Mitchell was being honored , however , the Northern Ireland Assembly that was the cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement was collapsing in a sea of recrimination and farce , as unionists and republicans refused to budge on their positions .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart , Bertie Ahern , had spent all their political capital earlier that month , setting deadlines that passed without agreement or sanction .
Mitchell had set a deadline last year , convinced that the parties would not reach an agreement without one .
After a series of meetings in the drab Castle Buildings office complex at Stormont here , where the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated in a series of segregated corners that mirror this segregated society , Mitchell asked the US ambassador to Britain , Philip Lader , if he could borrow Lader 's mansion in London 's Regents Park .
He barely made it back in time to deliver the eulogy .
Ahern said progress had been made , but did not elaborate .
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Trimble had no right to set deadlines unilaterally , and accused the British government of acting illegally by allowing Trimble to alter the terms of the Good Friday Agreement .
While proclaiming himself to be a democrat , Willie Thompson , a British parliamentarian and a vehement opponent of the Good Friday Agreement , said he saw no contradiction in refusing to accept the will of the majority of his party .
`` We will continue to fight , '' Thompson said , `` until Trimble and this agreement are finished. ''
But under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement , Magee became eligible for early release after serving only about a third of his sentence .
There was considerable progress made toward the end of last year . ''
He noted that the purpose of the meeting was to have a `` strategic view of what needs to be done to bring about the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday agreement . ''
`` I made it clear before I left -LRB- Northern -RRB- Ireland that Mr . Trimble has to lead his party and to be true to the Good Friday agreement , and doing it in the same way I have had to lead our party , '' he said .
So let 's go forward empowered by the progress that has made life so much better for people on the Island of Ireland , '' he added .
`` Unless the decommissioning -LRB- disarmament -RRB- issue is resolved with clarity and certainty in the next few weeks , I fear the chances of political agreement in Northern Ireland might be postponed for several years , '' Trimble told the conference .
Britain said the Irish Republican Army 's failure to give a clear commitment to hand in arms in line with the landmark Good Friday peace agreement left it with no choice .
`` The Good Friday Agreement is the foundation upon which new relationships between unionists and nationalists and republicans can be forged , '' he said .

The 7 1/2-foot aluminum-and- titanium capsule sank after splashdown on July 21 , 1961 , when its hatch blew open prematurely and the spacecraft filled with water .
A 180-foot ship , the Needham Tide , headed for the 3-mile- deep waters 300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral .
The ship was a day late raising anchor ; the crew needed time to get a new switch for a hydraulic power unit .
Newport estimated it would take at least one day to reach the area where he believes Grissom 's Liberty Bell 7 lies on the ocean floor .
Liberty Bell 7 sank 38 years ago this month .
`` It will be a big relief '' once the capsule is aboard ship , Curt Newport said before setting sail Thursday .
Newport and his team discovered Liberty Bell 7 on May 1 about 300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral .
The Houston company also supplied a bigger ship for this trip , which is expected to last 1 1/2 to two weeks .
Newport expects Liberty Bell 7 to be on deck by the end of next week if all goes well .
The ship will stop briefly at Fort Lauderdale on Sunday to pick up more people , including Jim Lewis , the helicopter pilot who tried unsuccessfully to rescue the capsule in 1961 , and Guenter Wendt , the launch pad leader who strapped in the Mercury astronauts .
An underwater salvage team spent eight hours in darkness late Monday and early yesterday reeling in the Liberty Bell 7 flown by astronaut Gus Grissom , the second American in space .
It arrived by ship at Cape Canaveral this morning , the 38th anniversary of its sinking after splashdown .
So it was almost like having this thing punch to the surface through some type of time portal or something , '' he said in a ship -to-shore news conference .
When Newport finally located the capsule again , the ship 's robot vessel was used to attach a sling to the capsule .
Because of problems recovering Liberty Bell 7 -- two days were wasted because of bad navigational data and the recovery vessel kept breaking -- Newport had no time to search for the hatch .
The answer to the enduring mystery of why the hatch blew may have been in the inside-the-capsule camera that was running when Liberty Bell 7 splashed down .
The recovery project was financed by the Discovery Channel , which plans to broadcast a two-hour special , `` In Search of Liberty Bell 7 , '' on Dec . 12 .
Once the restoration is complete , the Discovery Channel will take Liberty Bell 7 on a three-year tour , beginning about the middle of 2000 .

AUSTIN , Texas _ Two public interest groups Monday asked a federal court to strike down the money-riddled system of electing state judges , contending that it violates Texans ' right to fair and impartial courtrooms .
`` Texas has become notorious across the country as a state where ` justice is for sale , '' ' said Tom `` Smitty '' Smith of Public Citizen Inc . , one of the plaintiffs .
It was filed in U.S . district court by Public Citizen , the Gray Panthers and five individual Texas lawyers .
Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Phillips , an early supporter of efforts to junk the current system , called it a `` bad system that impairs public confidence in the courts . ''
Smith of Public Citizen said the Legislature `` has clearly had the opportunity and failed to remedy this problem. ''
The tactic drew criticism from House members and a public advocacy group that accused the agency of delaying publicizing reports on the workplace dangers of a toxic chemical featured in the film , `` Erin Brockovich . ''
But Carol Browner , the EPA administrator , predicted that Congress would not vote to stop the rules if it involved `` a full review , and a public review. ''
Scientists for the group , Public Citizen , asserted that the EPA had for five years delayed publicizing reports that the chemical was far more dangerous than previously thought .
Public Citizen also accused the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of delays in issuing tougher rules to protect workers from the compound .
Peter Lurie , deputy director of Public Citizens ' Health Research Group , said the delays in regulating the compound reflected what he called the administration 's systematic underenforcement in occupational safety .
He insisted that Public Citizen 's attacks were not intended to advance Nader 's candidacy .
But Public Citizen scientists , who obtained the study through the Freedom of Information Act , faulted the agency for waiting five years before publishing the findings .
Public Citizen officials complained Tuesday that no rule has been yet proposed , though OSHA officials said they plan to issue a rule by June 2001 .

Inhofe , R - Okla . , was not injured , but his single-engine airplane was slightly damaged , said press secretary Danny Finnerty .
Inhofe , an experienced , commercially rated pilot , was en route from northeastern Oklahoma to Oklahoma City , where he was to meet President , who was touring tornado-ravaged parts of central Oklahoma .
Sen . James Inhofe of Oklahoma is currently in line to ascend to the chairmanship , holding the greatest seniority among the panel 's GOP members .
In addition , he attended GOP fund-raising events in his home state and Washington .
Much attention has been focused on Chafee 's chairmanship at the Environment and Public Works Committee , a spot for which New Hampshire Sen . Bob Smith , a one-time Republican on the verge of rejoining the GOP , and Oklahoma Sen . James Inhofe are vying .
Sen . James Inhofe of Oklahoma , who is one seat below Smith on the panel , has also made clear his desire for the chairmanship .
The Oklahoma Republican said Clinton violated the agreement in August with ' '17 recess appointments in just an arrogant defiance of the Senate 's prerogative of advice and consent. ''
Congressmen publicly endorsed a Family Research Council luncheon in Washington honoring Reggie White , the Green Bay Packers star who decries homosexuality ; Sen . James Inhofe of Oklahoma likened philanthropist James Hormel , a gay nominee to be ambassador to Luxembourg , to David Duke ; and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott took to TV this week to brand gay people as sinners comparable to thieves .
The occasion was the state Republican Convention in Fort Worth .
Another guest on the program , Senator James M . Inhofe , Republican of Oklahoma , disagreed , saying that he has never heard any justification for `` having a lower standard for the president of the United States than a federal judge .
Among those speaking on Wednesday were Sens . James Inhofe of Oklahoma , Conrad Burns of Montana , Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Richard Shelby of Alabama , all Republicans ; and Sens . Patrick Leahy of Vermont , Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York , John Breaux of Louisiana , and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland , all Democrats .
He was first elected to office in 1956 as a Rhode Island state representative and served until 1963 , when he was elected governor for the first of three terms .
And Representative Bob Weygand , a Democrat from Rhode Island who is also running for the seat , said he hoped `` people would take time out to allow the family to grieve , and the state to grieve. ''
But because Smith has switched from the Republican Party to become an Independent , the chairmanship will likely go to Senator James M . Inhofe , Republican of Oklahoma , Senate aides said .
WASHINGTON _ The Senate is poised to alter the course of its environmental committee for the first time in decades by selecting a pro-business leader as its next chairman _ either James M . Inhofe of Oklahoma or Bob Smith of New Hampshire , who Monday rejoined the Republican Party and made a bid for the job .
WASHINGTON _ Sen . John Ashcroft disputes an Oklahoma colleague 's statement last week that the Missouri Republican was among 18 senators who favored blocking President Clinton 's judicial nominations for the rest of his term .

The Muslim Brotherhood is outlawed and many of its leaders are behind bars .
The brotherhood , a secretive band that helped create the modern Islamic revival , drew the crowd Monday to its annual `` iftar '' banquet , the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims do not eat or drink during daylight hours .
Despite the religious covering for the event , Mamoun el-Hodeiby , the deputy lead of the movement , concedes it was meant to demonstrate the brotherhood 's popularity .
`` This is testimony that everyone recognizes that the brotherhood is not a marginal organization but a mass movement which enjoys the trust and confidence of all walks of life , '' he told The Associated Press on Wednesday .
It was long unofficially tolerated , but since 1995 the government has clamped down on the group , accusing it of supporting a violent campaign by Muslim militants to overthrow the secular government .
It also received support from leading opposition figures who said the brotherhood should be accepted as a legal political party .
`` The brotherhood is a national movement which has deep roots in our society , '' Abdel Adhim Manaf , a leader of the pan- Arab Nasserite Party , said in an interview Tuesday .
`` All my life I believed that the brotherhood worked for the ...
The brotherhood in Egypt has undergone a split in recent years .
El-Hodeiby said the brotherhood itself is not giving up its demand for official recognition as a political party .
CAIRO , May 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Egyptian police detained 15 suspected members of the banned Muslim fundamentalist group , the Muslim Brotherhood , in the past 10 days , security officials said on Sunday .
More than 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been arrested since October 1999 , dozens of whom since the beginning of this month , in a growing government crackdown on the movement .
The Brotherhood , Egypt 's largest Muslim fundamentalist group , was banned in 1954 by the former president , Gamal Abdel Nasser , but has enjoyed intermittent periods of official tolerance .

WASHINGTON , April 4 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S . Space shuttle Columbia blasted off this afternoon on a 16-day mission to study how the near- zero gravity changes the freezing and melting processes , metal , plants , disease cells and especially fire .
During their space voyage , the astronauts will set as many as 200 small fires in Columbia 's laboratory .
WASHINGTON , May 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S space shuttle Columbia and its crew returned to Earth Sunday , ending two weeks of brain research in the space while the experiments were far from over , said reports reaching here .
NASA 's oldest shuttle and its seven member crew soared into orbit from Kennedy Space Center , Florida , at 2 : 20 p.m . EST , after a one-day delay because some of the shuttle 's coolant pipes were missing insulation .
Liftoff was originally scheduled for 2 p.m . this afternoon , but a troubled leak check of the shuttle cabin made NASA delay the launch for another 20 minutes .
The shuttle landed right on time at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Florida , where about 200 researchers waited with scalpels .
The trip added 6.4 million miles to the odometer of the oldest shuttle of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -LRB- NASA -RRB- .
After the shuttle landed , the crew was hustled off to medical tests that were expected to go on for days .

In fact , after Discovery returns from a flight scheduled for October -LRB- the 100th flight for the shuttle program -RRB- , it will be the veteran among the four - vehicle fleet with 28 flights .
NASA has tinkered with shuttle hardware all along as new orbiters were built , but the Challenger explosion resulted in hundreds of changes across the fleet to increase safety , from redesigned rocket boosters to more powerful flight control computers .
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala . , is in charge of the fourth major overhaul of the shuttle engines , one of the major upgrades in the works .
Marshall Space Flight Center is also in charge of managing the X-33 program , which is intended to lead to a commercially built vehicle called VentureStar that could one day perform many tasks handled by the shuttle or even replace it entirely .
NASA Administrator Dan Goldin has repeatedly complained that the high cost of flying payloads to space , some $ 10,000 per pound , is stifling progress in space flight .
King said United Space Alliance has 3,850 workers who process the shuttle after each flight and get it ready for the next one .

Feb . 20 , 1986 _ The Soviet Union launches Mir , its 10th and most successful space station .
In his 1986 address , which had been postponed for the first time in history due to the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger , Ronald Reagan began by saying , `` We paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes .
The cause of the explosion , which occurred less than 90 seconds after liftoff , remained undetermined over the weekend as investigators from Boeing and Hughes arrived at Cape Canaveral from California , where both companies ' space operations are based .
`` There '' is in a position to seriously challenge Arianespace , the European space agency , for leadership in commercial satellite launching .
Hughes ' biggest domestic competitor is Space Systems/Loral , while Europe 's largest makers of commercial satellites include Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi .
According to Landman of Panamsat , who spends much of his time shopping and negotiating for deals with satellite builders and launchers , the relative weakness of American companies in launching commercial satellites has its roots in the early 1980s , when NASA 's space shuttle was touted as the new way to get commercial payloads off the earth .
As the space shuttle proved itself , American launching companies focused almost exclusively on the military market .
But after the Challenger explosion , the Reagan administration severely cut back on the shuttle 's use for commercial purposes , arguing that it was not worth risking lives for tasks that could be performed by expendable rockets .
Last year , for the first time , the commercial space business in the United States was larger than the market for military aircraft _ $ 30.6 billion versus $ 30.5 billion _ according to the trade group .
Last fall , Panamsat opened a policy worth more than $ 3 billion with an insurance group led by Space Machine Advisors , based in Greenwich , Conn .
Referring to a Space Machine Advisors executive who was at the attempted launching last week , a Panamsat spokesman said , `` He was the one with the real pale look on his face. ''
`` The space program is for basic , fundamental research , '' Glenn said after McAuliffe , a Concord , N.H . , high school teacher , and six crewmates died in the Challenger tragedy .
What 's more , Glenn said , space flight should not be `` a cosmic carnival ride. ''
On Thursday , 12 years later , the 77-year-old Democratic senator from Ohio is poised to lift off for a shuttle ride in space .
And several critics are using his post- Challenger remarks against him .
Although they praised him as an America hero for his historic space flight in 1962 and wished him success on the nine-day journey that is scheduled to start Thursday at 2 p.m . , Glenn 's critics asserted Wednesday that his mission on the shuttle Discovery is no more vital to space science than McAuliffe 's education-based `` ultimate field trip '' was to have been .
`` This is a favor for someone who is a favorite son of the space program and has been loyal to the Clinton administration , '' said Lon Raines , editor of Space News , a weekly newspaper that covers the aerospace industry .
She was to have turned the shuttle into an orbiting classroom , conducting science experiments and lessons on space history that were to have been beamed by satellite to millions of American students .
McAuliffe was 37 when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff , killing the crew and effectively ending the civilian -in-space program .
Although Glenn expressed `` a profound , personal sense of loss '' over the Challenger tragedy , he questioned the decision to send civilians into space while the shuttle program was still in `` its embryonic stage. ''
`` If the taxpayers come to believe that the space program is becoming a cosmic carnival ride , then we face the very real prospect that they may withdraw their support , '' Glenn said .
After two years of aggressive lobbying to secure a seat on the Discovery flight , Glenn is scheduled to act as a human guinea pig for research on aging in the weightlessness of space .
Glenn failed to convince Rick Tomlinson , president of the Space Frontier Foundation , which promotes opening space travel to civilians .

SAN FRANCISCO _ The international space station that is being assembled 285 miles above Earth faces enough hazards to fill a stack of paperback science fiction thrillers .
Fires , explosions , solar flares , power failures and collisions with space debris could threaten the station _ history 's grandest construction project and humanity 's first stepping stone to Mars and worlds beyond .
Daniel Goldin , the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , expects to face `` countless problems and countless issues '' during station construction .
`` I do n't know of any large construction project on Earth where there has n't been injuries or deaths , '' said Dr . Julie Swain , a surgeon and member of the NASA Advisory Council that advises Goldin on space issues .
In space , `` you 're doing a bigger construction project in a horrible environment , '' said Swain , who works at the University of Kentucky .
The sheer size of the space station offers more opportunity for trouble .
They will study their physiological , psychological and orthopedic reactions to space flight , generating information useful for long-term missions to Mars and beyond .
The crew of the shuttle Endeavour is on a mission this week to assemble the first two components of the station _ the Russian Zarya -LRB- `` Sunrise '' -RRB- power module , which was launched Nov . 20 , and the American Unity module .
In deft maneuvers , the Russian and U.S . shuttle crew connected the two components Sunday and Monday .
In February 1997 , the crew of the aging Russian Mir space station , including American Jerry Linenger , fought `` an impressive , life-threatening fire .
Collisions between space station components during assembly .
Space debris .
Millions of pieces from prior space flights litter Earth 's orbit .
Traveling at many miles per second , they could punch holes in the space station , asphyxiating astronauts .
As long as the space station points within a 15 -degree plane relative to its orbit , it will capture enough sunlight to electrify its solar panels .
Dangerous space walks or `` extravehicular activities '' -LRB- EVAs -RRB- , lasting a total of more than 1,000 hours , during which astronauts will assemble station components .
A former NASA engineer and space writer , he left the agency this year .
And if NASA officials think Mir taught them about space station hazards , he said , `` this could be the road to more disasters. ''
Disasters struck the first space stations .
In 1971 , the Soviets launched Salyut 1 ; its three -man crew asphyxiated on re-entry when their space capsule lost air pressure .
Two years later , the United States launched a roomy , cylindrical space station called Skylab .
NASA officials remain optimistic that they 've done everything they could to keep space station builders and inhabitants safe .
Two decades after its birth , and 13 years after its worst tragedy , the space shuttle has become America 's year-round trucking service into space , an aging but respected draft horse in orbit .
But the venerable shuttle fleet is n't likely to be replaced for decades to come , NASA officials , engineers and former astronauts say because Congress is unlikely to give the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the money .
Hence the shuttle _ packed with technology that dates , in some cases , to the 1950s and 1960s _ may become the B-52 bomber of the early 21st century : a high-tech antique , still piercing the skies in the 2020s and 2030s , flown by pilots who were n't even alive when it first flew .
The B-52 analogy is valid , said Bernard Shaw , a former space shuttle commander who is now vice president and general manager of the International Space Station project for Boeing Co .
the space shuttle will be hard to replace , '' he said .
Scheduled for completion about 2005 , the space station is being assembled primarily by shuttle launches that carry components to low Earth orbit .
Delayed retirement is a noble but ironic fate for the shuttle fleet , which almost died in its crib in the 1970s , when then-President Richard Nixon half-heartedly proposed it to a reluctant Congress .
Yet 13 years later , long after doomsayers had predicted a second shuttle disaster to occur , the fleet is still flying an average of seven to eight times a year .
`` We 're not going to come anywhere near the life span of the shuttle in the next 10 years , '' former space shuttle commander Andrew Allen told conferees at the Space Shuttle Development Conference at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View Thursday .
Allen is now director of space shuttle development for United Space Alliance , a shuttle -managing consortium created by the Lockheed Martin Corp . and Boeing that has managed shuttle flights under contract to NASA since 1996 .
Federal funding is so tight that William Readdy , NASA 's deputy associate administrator for space flight , jokingly denied Thursday that he was `` back in Washington holding a bake sale to see if we could fund some of these -LRB- shuttle -RRB- upgrades. ''
Placing electronic components inside the whitish tiles that serve as the shuttle 's skin and protect it from severe heat as it re-enters the atmosphere .

Shaw , the former shuttle commander , insists that NASA must make do with the shuttles for a long time to come .
On the other hand , he acknowledged , the nation must consider developing a complementary or backup space transportation system .

what immediately came to my mind was the whole Challenger thing , '' he said .
Lyn Glenn said the close relationships that developed among Discovery 's crew and family members during training helped her accept her father 's decision .
`` I ca n't say enough good about how NASA treats families and how NASA has taken great consideration of the other human beings involved in this besides the crew , '' she said .
`` Over these months I 've gotten to know the crew and I 've learned more and more and more , and I think it 's very exciting .
Members who have died include Paul Williams -LRB- 1973 -RRB- ; Ruffin -LRB- 1991 -RRB- ; Kendricks -LRB- 1992 -RRB- ; and Franklin -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .
I seem to remember pictures of Ronald Reagan at the Challenger launch when it blew up .
Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger .
The station 's three -member crew later die during their return to Earth when their Soyuz capsule decompresses .
Sept . 29 , 1988 _ Americans return to space aboard the shuttle Discovery , after a 32-month absence in the wake of the Challenger accident .
The shuttle likely will support the station 's cargo and crew rotation needs for much of the 10-year operations period that follows .
Its multicolored displays could replace many of the 2,000 mechanical dials , gauges and switches that protrude from every surface of the shuttle crew cabin .
Once a crew reaches space it can electronically store the displays needed for the launch phase and replace them with those needed just for the orbital phase .
More than 200 safety modifications followed the loss of Challenger , most notably the redesign of the solid-fuel booster that triggered the disaster .
These changes , among thousands of major and minor design modifications that were made since the shuttles started flying , included redesigned solid-fuel booster rockets , more spacecraft sensors and a parachute escape system for the crew .
`` The shuttle is a rocket for eight -and-a -half minutes capable of carrying a crew and cargo , but the shuttle is also a spacecraft that can operate independently in space for eight to 14 days , '' Goldin said .
NASA plans to appoint a panel to look into what went wrong , and members of Congress announced this week they will hold hearings on the matter in February .
Some members of Congress downplayed the financial impact of the loss .

Challenger explosion .
WASHINGTON _ The day after the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 , Senator John Glenn blasted NASA 's decision to send Christa McAuliffe on the fatal mission .
`` The space program is for basic , fundamental research , '' Glenn said after McAuliffe , a Concord , N.H . , high school teacher , and six crewmates died in the Challenger tragedy .
What 's more , Glenn said , space flight should not be `` a cosmic carnival ride. ''

NASA and some advocates for broader research on aging have defended Glenn 's role on the Discovery flight as a potentially valuable contribution to science .
Tomlinson characterized Glenn 's scheduled flight the way some of McAuliffe 's prelaunch critics described her mission .
