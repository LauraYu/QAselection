An estimated 50,000 Americans practice Wicca , a form of polytheistic nature worship .
The inch- thick chaplain handbook includes a five -page primer on Wicca , described as `` a reconstruction of the Nature worship of tribal Europe . ''
With its lack of a central hierarchy and rigid rules , the earth -based religion of Wicca draws members from a mix of movements : feminists , environmentalists and New Age seekers who worship the gods and goddesses of nature by casting sacred circles and celebrating the changing seasons .
With Kiernan , at least , Bush is still paying for a statement he made last year that Wicca _ whose practitioners call themselves witches and believe in the dual deity of god and goddess _ is not a religion and should not be practiced on military bases .

The U.N . team spent a week in Cambodia to assess existing evidence for a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during the Maoist guerrillas ' 1975-79 rule of Cambodia .
Key events in the history of Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge movement : ___ _ 1949-52 : Saloth Sar , later known as Pol Pot , goes to Paris on government scholarship and becomes absorbed with communist ideology .
1978 : Vietnam invades Cambodia to stop Khmer Rouge border attacks .
On the 25th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia , Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday an agreement may finally be at hand to set up a court to prosecute the movement 's former leaders whose reign of terror killed 1.7 million people .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders ended their six-day grand tour of the country Sunday and returned to a remote jungle town that has become a well-guarded haven for defectors from the Communist movement , officials said .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia _ As passions rise over whether to put former leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial , King Norodom Sihanouk volunteered Monday to join them in the dock to answer for his past associations with the brutal communist movement .
The two men were allowed to tour the capital , Phnom Penh , then visit the seaside resort of Sihanoukville and the temples of Angkor before returning last Monday to Pailin , an enclave of former Khmer Rouge in a remote area of western Cambodia .
U.S . officials said one compromise would call for the defectors , Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea , to be charged with crimes against humanity that occurred from 1975 to 1979 , when the Khmer Rouge under the leadership of Pol Pot ruled Cambodia _ and not for crimes that took place afterward .
Khieu Samphan , who was the head of state of the Khmer Rouge government , and Nuon Chea , who as Pol Pot 's second in command was known as `` Brother No . 2 , '' defected late last month after spending most of the last two decades in jungle redoubts along Cambodia 's border with Thailand .
Pol Pot died in April in a Khmer Rouge guerrilla camp in western Cambodia , apparently of natural causes .
He was the titular head of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas during the civil war from 1970 to 1975 , and then was briefly head of state of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge period .
Three international jurists hired by the United Nations are in Cambodia , looking at the evidence against the most important Khmer Rouge leaders and assessing the feasibility of trials .
NEW YORK _ After months of wavering , Cambodia Friday officially rejected U.N . recommendations to convene a tribunal to try surviving senior Khmer Rouge leaders , seeming to kill any chance of an international court .
Hor Nam Hong , Cambodia 's foreign minister , flew to New York and informed U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan that Cambodia would hold a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders in its own courts .
The official rejection was announced days before the secretary general was scheduled to make public the recommendation of a panel of experts that the United Nations convene a tribunal to try a dozen or more senior Khmer Rouge leaders outside of Cambodia .
The Cambodian trial would cover the period from 1975 to 1979 when the Khmer Rouge governed Cambodia , taking the lives of 2 million Cambodians .
But Hor Nam Hong said Friday that with the help of international jurists , Cambodia could try the Khmer Rouge in the country where `` we were all their victims . ''
Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia was one of the modern world 's most brutal regimes .
Ieng Sary with several thousand Khmer Rouge forces broke away from the guerrilla movement and crossed over to the government of Cambodia in August last year .
PHNOM PENH , December 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Cambodia 's Top Khmer Rouge political leader Khieu Samphan has surrendered to the government , a local radio reported Saturday .
In his letter , Hun Sen reiterated that `` We have never rejected the accountability of the Khmer Rouge leaders for the crimes of genocide in Cambodia . ''
`` We just want , however , to caution that any decision to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to justice must also take into full account the Cambodia 's need for peace , national reconciliation ... , '' he stressed .
`` Therefore , if improperly and heedlessly conducted , the trials of Khmer Rouge leaders would panic other former Khmer Rouge officers and its rank and file , who have already surrendered , into turning back to the jungle and renewing the guerrilla war in Cambodia , '' Hun Sen pointed out .
The U.N . experts came to Cambodia last November to investigate the Khmer Rouge issues and made the report to Kofi Annan .
UNITED NATIONS , May 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The agreement to try Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge may be near and the United Nations is going to send its chief legal counsel to the country to wrap up the details , U.N . spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday .

The Khmer Rouge , who caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979 , remained a potent guerrilla force in 1993 and boycotted the polls , threatening to kill Cambodians who voted .
After seizing power in 1975 , the Khmer Rouge turned Cambodia into a slave labor camp and caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people .
Attacks on ethnic Vietnamese fishing villages followed , as did failed military offensives against the Vietnamese-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas , who seized power in 1975 and began a reign of terror that cost the lives of as many as 2 million Cambodians .
He portrays himself as a human-rights advocate who `` never condoned the class struggle and violation of human rights '' after the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975 .

The defectors were key players in the Khmer Rouge 's rule after the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 .
The doctoral thesis he submitted at the University of Paris in 1959 is seen as a blueprint of Khmer Rouge economic policy once it seized power in 1975 _ economic self-reliance and the collectivization of agriculture .
The Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh on April 17 , 1975 , and cut Cambodia off from the world .
Sihanouk was named head of state after the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 , but was locked in his palace by the communists as they embarked on their brutal attempt to create an agrarian utopia .
He then allowed himself to be named head of state when the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 under the leadership of Pol Pot , who died last year .

Bott 's work with quarks , an elementary particle found in protons and neutrons , has contributed to the string theory , the so-called `` theory of everything '' to explain the universe .
Dr . Henry Way Kendall , one of three physicists who shared a Nobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were the basic building blocks of matter , died on Monday while on an underwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park , south of Tallahassee , Fla . He was 72 and lived in Sharon , Mass .
Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks , the infinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and neutrons , which were once thought to be matter 's fundamental particles .
`` It 's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science , '' said Jerome Friedman , a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the American Physical Society .
In those first instants , scientists believe , subatomic particles called quarks and gluons roamed freely , rather than being locked inside the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei , as they seem to be now .
Its crucial component is the `` strange quark '' - one of six types of quarks , which are the tiniest building blocks of matter .
If `` strange stars '' are positively identified by Usov 's criteria , this would finally settle a major dispute in particle physics on the existence of matter composed of quarks - the most stable matter in the universe , the report said .
</A>
<A 38.2 >
In the current `` standard model '' of the universe , all matter is fundamentally made up of six particles called quarks -LRB- whimsically so named by the late Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann for James Joyce 's cryptic quotation `` Three Quarks for Muster Mark '' in Finnegan 's Wake -RRB- plus three electrons , tau particles , and muons , plus three kinds of neutrinos .
Among the major achievements in physics I was privileged to report were the discovery of the top quark at Fermilab _ the last of six quarks predicted by theory _ and the discovery in Japan that the elusive neutrino particle probably has some mass , a finding with profound implications for the fate of the universe .
</A>
<A 38.3 >
Their equations were vital in calculating the mass of the top quark , which was observed for the first time in 1995 at the Fermilab in the United States .
The bet , which won him dinner for four , was regarding the existence and mass of the top quark , an elementary particle discovered to much in 1995 .
The stupendous power of the Tevatron made possible the 1995 discovery of the top quark _ the last of six flavors of quarks predicted by the standard model theory of particle physics .
Mr . Kendall won the Nobel prize in physics in 1990 , along with Friedman and Richard Taylor of Stanford , for work done at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the 1960s that produced the first direct evidence for the existence of quarks _ tiny particles that combine in groups of three to form the subatomic particles , such as protons , from which matter is made .
The most conspicuous achievement of the Tevatron in its 14 years of operation was the discovery in 1995 of the `` top quark , '' which filled in the last blank space for six quarks allotted by a table of fundamental particles known as the Standard Model .

For much of the 1920s , Teapot Dome _ a classic tale of oil tycoons , $ 100 bills and a jailed Cabinet member _ was the talk of the nation .
It was the first trial of former Cabinet officials since the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s , and it was the first time in the country 's history that two former Cabinet officials were tried together .
In 1923 , as the tawdriness of the Teapot Dome scandal began to leak out , Harding lamented , `` My God , this is a hell of a job .

Last fall , Congress decreed he will be the last in a long line of naval officers who have kept an eye on the oil field since a scandal rocked President Warren Harding 's administration in 1922 .
`` Perhaps the most surprising single event of Harding 's presidency was his blunt speech on Oct . 26 , 1921 , to a segregated crowd in Birmingham , Ala . , stating that democracy would always be a sham until African-Americans received full equality in education , employment and political life .
But the scandal that really smeared the memory of President Warren Harding bubbled 75 years ago from Teapot Dome , a vast pool of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here .
After Harding 's death in 1923 , his vice president , Calvin Coolidge , succeeded him and restored respectability to a White House blackened by Teapot Dome and other scandals .

The 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate cult committed mass suicide in March 1997 after leader Marshall Herff Applewhite instructed his followers to shed their earthly `` containers '' to catch a ride on a UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet .
In 1997 , the bodies of 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate techno-religious cult who 'd committed suicide were found inside a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe , Calif .
Many people in and around Eatonton -- a rural community that was the birthplace of Alice Walker , author of `` The Color Purple , '' and Joel Chandler Harris , creator of the Uncle Remus tales -- fear the Nuwaubians are similar to Heaven 's Gate , the cult whose 39 members committed mass suicide in 1997 in Rancho Santa Fe , Calif . , and the People 's Temple followers of Jim Jones .
Referring to the mass suicide by 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate group last year , Weaver said he feared that the Concerned Christians could take a similar turn , saying , `` The best way to describe this is Heaven 's Gate . ''
The items were the last earthly possessions of the 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate cult who killed themselves nearly three years ago in hopes of boarding a spaceship that they believed was trailing the Hale-Bopp comet .
The items auctioned by county officials were the last earthly possessions of the 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate cult who killed themselves nearly three years ago in hopes of boarding a spaceship that they believed was trailing the Hale-Bopp comet .
Late last month , more than 350 people turned out in San Diego to bid for the possessions of the members of the Heaven 's Gate cult whose 39 in-house fanatics did away with themselves in a mass suicide .
The 39 men and women who committed suicide were members of a cult known as Heaven 's Gate , the authorities said .
And 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate cult in the U.S . committed suicide in California on March 26 , 1997 .

Many people in and around Eatonton -- a rural community that was the birthplace of Alice Walker , author of `` The Color Purple , '' and Joel Chandler Harris , creator of the Uncle Remus tales -- fear the Nuwaubians are similar to Heaven 's Gate , the cult whose 39 members committed mass suicide in 1997 in Rancho Santa Fe , Calif . , and the People 's Temple followers of Jim Jones .
The similarities between the Nuwaubians and the 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate sect in Rancho Santa Fe , Calif . , who committed mass suicide in March 1997 , were too close to ignore , Sills said .

The near certainty of Bashar Assad 's succession of his father , President Hafez Assad , gets a fresh boost Saturday when Syria 's ruling Baath party meets to elect him party leader and declare his candidacy for president .
Bashar Assad is a Baath party member -- one of an estimated 1.5 million -- but until now has not held any formal position in the party , which was founded in the 1940s and has held power since 1963 .
Syria 's ruling Baath Party opened its first conference in 15 years Saturday to elect Bashar Assad party leader and declare his candidacy for president , putting him closer to succeeding his father , the late President Hafez Assad .
Bashar Assad is a Baath party member -- one of an estimated 1.5 million -- but until now has not held any formal position in the party .
On Saturday , Syria 's ruling Baath Party opened its first conference in 15 years to elect Bashar Assad party leader and declare his candidacy for president , putting him closer to succeeding his father .
Syria 's ruling Baath party nominated Bashar Assad for president on Tuesday , making it virtually certain he will succeed his late father as leader of the country .
Addressing the closing session of the party 's congress , Bashar Assad vowed that Baath would remain faithful to the principles laid down by his father , President Hafez Assad .
Bashar Assad rejected suggestions that the Baath party , which has monopolized power since 1963 , was becoming antiquated .
The ruling Baath Party elected Bashar Assad to the post of secretary general of its executive on Saturday -- bringing the 34-year-old another step closer to taking over the presidency left vacant by his father 's death .
Since the June 10 death of his father , President Hafez Assad , the parliament , the Baath Party and state-controlled media have been promoting Bashar Assad as Syria 's next leader .
The state television also said that the leadership of the ruling Baath Party had voted unanimously to nominate Bashar Assad for the presidency .

But there was little doubt Saturday that the late president 's wish was being honored and that Bashar Assad , a British -educated ophthalmologist , was headed for the presidency .

Parliament formally announced that Bashar Assad 's swearing-in ceremony will be on July 17 , after which he will embark on a seven-year term that is full of risks .
Assad , an ophthalmologist by training , officially began a seven-year term after taking the oath of office before the 250 -member Syrian Parliament .
Lahoud congratulated Assad on winning his fifth seven-year term as president in a referendum held in Syria on Thursday , in which Assad was the only candidate .

Born in Jaffa in then- Palestine in 1937 , Abu Nidal 's main targets have been Israelis .
Born in Jaffa in 1937 , he has ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion of treason , which accounts for his ability to elude authorities around the world for so long .
The opposition party organ Wafd , quoting Palestinian sources , reported on Monday that Abu Nidal , a Palestinian born in Jaffa in 1937 , is suffering from terminal leukaemia and receiving treatment in an Egyptian hospital .
</A>
<A 48.2 >
Palestinian officials have told The Associated Press that Abu Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _ is either jailed or hospitalized in Egypt .
The Report named the second man as the notorious terrorist Sabri al-Banna , better known as Abu Nidal , who is rumored to be hospitalized with leukemia in Egypt , though the Egyptian government has denied Nidal is in their country .
Despite official denials in Cairo , U.S . and Arab intelligence officials said the 61-year-old Palestinian , whose real name is Sabri Al Banna , was double-crossed in a murky spy-against-spy plot after being used to identify Islamic fundamentalists plotting terrorist acts in Egypt .
</A>
<A 48.3 >
However , most of the incidents blamed on Abu Nidal occurred years ago , and he is now believed to have only a few hundred followers , mostly in Lebanon .
Abu Nidal still has 200 to 300 followers in his organization , and they have been active in recent years , especially against Arab targets .

Mitchell , acting as Clinton 's envoy , shepherded the warring factions in Northern Ireland to the political settlement known as the Good Friday agreement in April 1998 .
Mitchell , a former U.S . senator , chaired the negotiations that produced the Good Friday 1998 agreement on forming a new Protestant - Catholic government for Northern Ireland .
Major will perhaps be best remembered for the advances he made towards Northern Ireland peace , paving the way for the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 .
In April 1998 , in what students of politics consider a masterful piece of diplomacy , Mitchell got most of the parties here to sign the Good Friday Agreement , which was meant to transform the debate over whether Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom or merge with the Republic of Ireland from a violent conflict to one decided by democratic politics .
While Dublin remains reluctant to go along with a suspension of the fledgling government in Belfast , Britain was determined not to allow Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble to walk out , as he had vowed to do Friday unless London agreed to suspend the political institutions created by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 .
About 10 percent of the places on the Ulster Unionist 's ruling council are allocated to Orange Order members , a built-in minority opposed to the power-sharing ethos of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 , the blueprint for the peace process .
Magee is the 277th prisoner to be given early release under the Good Friday Agreement , a landmark deal signed by Northern Ireland ' s feuding political groups in April 1998 aimed at ending 30 years of violence .
Mike Hammer , a spokesman for the National Security Council , said they focused on all aspects of implementing the Good Friday accord , the historical peace agreement signed by the parties in 1998 .
The April 1998 Good Friday peace Agreement could go into cold storage if there is no movement on the arms issue , he added .
He noted the British government had `` made a commitment '' in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to demilitarization .

As the seconds ticked away , there was mostly silence , a hush expectancy perhaps mindful of the terrible explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986 about 90 seconds into flight when the booster separation went awry .
